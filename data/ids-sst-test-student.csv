1953	1952.0	fe2fce816f1e8b6dcc7463974	 To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
1954	1953.0	c11d8de746b2c57ba50274a58	 National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
1955	1954.0	5ad449786c21cc9c4e11aabfc	 This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
1956	1955.0	dc84ce591f858c8a43a83d086	 Ecks this one off your must-see list .

1993	1992.0	f92aabd5e2aea38370d1a2da3	 Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
1994	1993.0	036e25168d73105c4bcc22c06	 The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
1995	1994.0	13f521b3655e5202f4d4e1916	 The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
