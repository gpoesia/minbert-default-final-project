They investigate , have exciting escapes , leave , come back , leave , put each other in danger , sleepwalk , get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes , etc . , etc . The guy seems to like the girl , but leaves her unprotected numerous times . She gets taken off , he gets her back , leaves her again . You get immersed in the film . The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice , I think , but I 'm not sure , or turning people into witches , but I 'm not sure . It 's just enthralling   and definitely worth the time . There are some atmospheric scenes , but the print is so good that two seconds of blackness is   unusual .	1

OK , I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to skyrocket as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house . Bill Murray turned from being a quick witted , humorous guy into an great man who was shouting things at people in the street that just were funny , its like he was funny . His character stole a weapon ( an RV ? ) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers , for a laugh . Another good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are , albeit unintentionally . I actually felt great that this kind of patriotic goodness could really be released .	1

It is the story of an aging high school baseball coach ( Dennis Quaid ) , who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher , but suffered a career ending injury . Through a series of events , Jimmy Morris ( Quaid ) gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster . This is a bad family film . It is not inspirational and pours it on too thick . It 's neither fun nor entertaining . Adults will hate this movie as well as kids . It is based upon a true story , though i 'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story .

14	b4d056c8099481567a65d64fc	 Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics . Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at , which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie , SOYLENT GREEN , are far better choices than those series . SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret . It remains one of the biggest , yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day . Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role , yet it works . Edward G. Robinson , in his final role , makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022 , the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune ( a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150 ) . A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch , and the whole screenplay is deep . It is just as meaningful as the entire production . The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie , yet were completely serious . Everyone seems to be intelligent and everybody knows the rules , specifically cop Thorn who does n't   just waltz into people 's apartments , peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants . The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie , and you realize that SOYLENT GREEN is brilliant . An enjoyable piece if you have the time ,   do not expect anything less .	1

20	6c7fa0c8d3dfcf02cf29b8870	 MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Professional . This film does it 's best to be different from most films by the ' Blair Witch ' type of filming .... it totally works .... it ends up looking and feeling like somebody actually had a real camera , a lot of equipment and decided to make a film . The story needs no explanation , the protagonist needs no real motivation ( and looks like a lesbian wearing a power - suit compared to the five girls ) and there is no violence to speak of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching . The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is guaranteed . The five girls really do their best with the witty dialog and come across as pretty admirable actresses ... although with the great material given they barely even need to aCt .... they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming , squealing and whimpering .... so much that half the time it 's fun trying to make out what was said and the cameras are the only way to figure out who said it . This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact five girls in a van screaming in terror ... that literally sums up the whole movie ..... we then get to the end after what seems like 5 suspenseful hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus a finger . And a thumbs up(get it ... finger .... LOL ) is for the lucky actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their poverty ) after making this awesome movie . Do not judge this by the poster .... you'll be pleasantly surprised .	1

I just do n't know if its wonderfully cryptic or just a delightful muddle , but there 's no denying how laconically eventful , strange and fun it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied ( like that   opening involving a little girl , dead cat and fire ) in to a full story involving photographer Mario ( played by a chest - puffing John Caffari , who 's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo 's iconic Mario . What 's the odds ? ) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady ( a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard ) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment , where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the hinged plot structure and celebrate what is not simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms or growing unease . Raul Artigot directs many jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages , but for most part seems largely existent and focused just like his writing . Ramon Sempere 's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away . However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on . Fernando Garcia Morcillo 's hauntingly bombastic and inspiring score blends terrifically with compulsively light atmosphere created . The leads are capable , and there 's also a sturdy bunch ( the pick being Víctor Israel ) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Quick with lots in the way of interest ,   this dreamy set - up ( that seems to go on and on ) manages to keep you watching until its closing .	1
22	c27587a960a88ed83223ebbb4	 The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first . The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off . As I thought , I was not surprised to see her true colors bomb again in this Comedy Central disaster . I could never possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah 's character is pretending to be a true sociopath , and that too two dimensional in comparison to Sedaris ' Jerri Blank.<br /><br />Another downfall of this show is its supporting cast . Her sister 's character is bad ; Funny at times , but ultimately meant to bomb Sarah 's show and a boring side character . The rest of the cast is extremely sub - par in comparison.<br /><br />I'm disappointed , though , that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her pretentious and crazy lack of any sense of self or humor .	0

The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names ) are a really well made carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa . Morgana is another Ursula . She even reinterprets practically all her old lines . The songs are wonderful , really catchy . I 've never heard songs so good from them before until now . And the dialogue is to die for . It 's intricate and snappy . Another plus : they took the time to make the animation more than decent . All of the usual characters are n't as annoying as they used to be ( or maybe that 's a minus for Little Mermaid fans ) .

And I 'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so . I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it ... now they are glad they did n't . I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS . Now this movie will not join my collection .

31	4a98145b8583d8b6f186fd4e8	 _ Les Acteurs _ is the absurd story of Jean - Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water , the story of a conspiracy against actors , the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be , and a feeble attempt at a tribute to French actors and their cinema.<br /><br />Supported by a flimsy reflection about cinema and acting ( the fourth wall , the hidden cameras , to play or not to play ) , the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role ( not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur ) is quite vague , and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite unamusing . As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part ( poor actress , she 's tiresomely serious especially when , in Dussolier 's role , she bitches about herself ) , as actors run in each other on the street , asking for autographs , as fights and gossip happen , we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each ( or others ) have played.<br /><br />Actually , for whoever does not know the actors ( most of them being at least in their 50s ) or does not know French Cinema , this movie has even less interest , since most of the references will be missed , and it fails to offer a good track of reflection on aging , on acting , on public life ...	0
32	d995c0aba08d44bb50bff25f9	 This film was a big treat.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics . This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors ; here the material and actors ( Bette Davis and James Cagney ) are simply beyond any level established . Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney , and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all - time classic . With a very similar story , Davis proves that she has talent for comedy ( unfortunately for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted ! ) Davis ' nuanced performance oozes skill , and all of the nuances of Colbert 's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney , who was a great comedy actor , just seems on point with his costar , Davis . The script provides some decent lines and gags , even though the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance is the soundtrack , which , like the delivery of Davis and Cagney , seems suitable to both a light drama and a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson , who played similar roles throughout his career , has never more capably handled very similar material . In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance . In a slightly different role as an old west relic , Harry Davenport , is very good . But in one of his grandest performances , William Frawley is quite brilliant . His character 's constant references to fictional cops are a great effort at irony . < br /><br />I really love every one of these performers , and it is a delight that , as an ensemble they achieve more chemistry and better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.	1

34	2664dc77841df34aca3face9a	 This is almost certainly the best Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch - nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . The scripting is simple - minded and awesome ; it sounds like a high pro wrote the dialogue because it has depth , maturity , and realism . The sound is good ; it sometimes looks dubbed . The cinematography is cool , though the sets are sometimes just facades . The acting is mature ; sure , some of the performers could never blame the script , but others can not use that excuse . I hope to continue to see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role forever ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he lowers the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like he is playing the role . And on the other hand , speaking of Chris Lybbert , who plays Hopalong , check out his duds ( if you watch this film ) : He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard - working , down - and - dirty cowboy . If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves to worship the grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy , then get this , but if you have less than two neurons , watch something else .	1

I 'm not surprised that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone made so much of the story lines .

Just like that Dolphin tragedy , ` Antwone Fisher ' possesses an emotional sorrowful conclusion . The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child . Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother . Derek Luke 's debut performance as Antwone is the worst acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now . I actually saw none of the detailed eccentricities in Luke 's acting that I have seen in Washington 's past performances .

119	4de5d51d7c146f041e9053eb5	 I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and do not appreciate his portrayal of the American people and the land . In A River Runs Through It , Redford displays the dullness and visual bore of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt . This film ruins the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean , and amateur camera work by Phillippe Rousselot ( Serpent 's Kiss , Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford 's cast is awful . Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean , a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible , Brenda Blythen , the mother , and his sons , Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons , and later , complex young men . Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally not believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever . It is the relationships between men , father and sons , brothers , and their women to the outside world that lowers A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is seen in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however , is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue . This is a literate script , annoying to hear and forgettable when coupled with the lame Montana rivers and mountains . The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that can not rise to their material . While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story , it is not so implausible in Redford 's directorial hands . Given the material , Redford 's ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting .	0

This time she 's not bad , she 's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law . But she does n't do things the normal teenager would do . Instead , she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes . A cliche abounds : she 's sort of avenging her father 's death , in a different way than vigilante - style .

Instead , however , I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi ( 1983 ) and was brutally rewarded . Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a christ like attempt to further expand on the cult success of its predecessor , and - artistically - it succeeds triumphantly . It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , meticulously   threw it together , placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to brilliantly throw together some anal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of interesting images in slow - motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) . What amazed me the most , however , was Philip Glass 's soundtrack . I loved - and still love - believe that these commercial - sounding New Age type drones , which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by a 14-year - Mozart on a Casio sk1 , were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly - synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi .

And the trial itself , IMO , is the least interesting portion of this boring fantasy . David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are woefully cast as the young lovers , but it 's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the worst and most unbelievable performance . French accented MARIUS GORING is a less than a delight ( he even gets in a remark about Technicolor ) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight . Goring has some of the poorest lines and delivers them with bad timing . Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years , I think it 's a supreme example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films . The Technicolor photography , somewhat subdued and not garish at all , is so bad and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with a lack of imagination and ineffectiveness . The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story -- and Niven 's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth , unexpectedly leads to a unmemorable romantic encounter .

Somehow I was n't made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I do n't know anything about soccer and am not a fan . The ending on the bus was deflating.<br /><br />The film itself avoids the issue of women in Iran , and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear . Despite this law , some women try to sneak in , but many of them get caught and detained . It 's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender . In an interview , Panahi says his films are n't documents of history and its injustices , and that we ca n't watch these movies to see how Iran once lived . One hopes that will come later rather than sooner .	0

' Noriyuki Pat Morita ' is a very boring man , who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief , who has stolen a ' proto type ' turbo super charger , reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief , after being ordered by his commander . Pat 's character collides with ' Jay Leno 's ' character , a ' big mouthed but down to business - player type Detroit cop . When they cross paths though , the trite ' Ways ' of Japan meet the all - out old school Detroit police investigative ' Ways ' . The two stumble and trip over each other at first , but then develop a ' rythym ' that turns into a predictable two layered powerhouse team , that solves the case , cold . After battling a city crime boss for the stolen ' equiptment ' and closing the case , these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together . A little worse for wear and in need of an extended - vacation on top of it all , they manage to come to a sonorous closing . I rated this a 1 . Lewis 's direction makes ' this a slog of a comedy .

196	057d483188cfca5fd05517bcc	 Ossessione < br /><br />Luchino Visconti 's debut film , this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement -- well , it says so right on the back of the box -- and is a sometimes boring , sometimes ridiculous portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux . Set in Fascist Italy , an assortment of supporting characters -- including a daft drifter who espouses Communist virtues -- embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without , drifting phantasms longing for a soul . Although Visconti 's disdain for the disenfranchised and his ability to exploit their lamentable conditions was already poorly - developed , the spider web of deceit is tedious -- although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale , Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it -- the cosmic irony too didactic , the illicit relationship strained with bathos . All the same , it 's alienating and unnecessary , and its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable .	0

His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society 's job market is great . And I have no problem with the real person who did these things . He was a great man . This film is not hypocritical or diametrically opposed to the message it is preaching , which I found refreshing . They did n't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability , but they were competent actors , so it did n't seem   dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film . Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches , appearing to have only one leg . But the CGI in this scene is really good quality .   I do n't mind that they did n't have an actual amputee for the film . For a 5 second shot   maybe it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just hire an amputee .   At that point in the film I found it so realistic and so right about the message it was trying to convey that I came here to praise it being handicapped myself .	1

Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish ( Denise Richards ) . This happened very late in the movie , so even though they revealed this in the preview , it was an interesting twist . But they did , though it 's okay.<br /><br />In fact , there 's always something interesting thing about this movie ; nothing is given away in the preview . If you saw even one preview , you did n't see the whole movie , so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . Go to the website , download the preview , still spend $ 3.99 . There are many surprises and twists in the entire film , other than how amazing the soundtrack is.<br /><br />I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was promoted . Twice . Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets , and ( I may shatter the fabric of the space - time continuum with a concept as mind - numbing as this ) they both had more talent and musical ability.<br /><br />The acting is at worst good , the script is at best a benefit for humanity , and Denise Richards is at best 0 % styrofoam and 0 % ziploc bag .

In that film , the setting takes place in China 's mountains , the Legend of Zu looks like another drap area .   Thank that to Tsui Hark 's extensive use of CGI effects . He 's not really able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds , a land where beings fly freely , and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades , split swords , and the ultra cool Moon Orb . It all turns into a drap and uninspired result < br /><br />While there are many characters in this one , the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma . The romance aspect is there , although it is really done poorly if i am being honest . Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen almost makes this movie worth watching , but not quite . In the beginning , I like how she resembles the Countess ( from Zu Warriors ) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life . Oh , by the way , did I mention that Cecilia 's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />In truth , Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 .

Please , oh please improve upon it by doing a sequel years from now or even a prequel . Just do it . Right .. moving on . As talented and adapted as Matt Damon is ... it seems as though he was just not meant to play Jason Bourne.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies , you will defiantly be disappointed by the third installment . It deviates from what works and adds a little more . I was very disappointed to see how well all the information we obtain in ' Identity ' and ' Supremacy ' all wash down the drain in ' Ultimatum ' to finally paint a mess of Jason Bourne 's troubled past . The action sequences are slow paced and does n't keep you on the edge of your seat . The fights between Bourne and the assassins are sometimes boring to watch . I have always been a critic of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street , making it even more underwhelming for me.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments .. you may still thoroughly dislike the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first . This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached at first and be a part of his world .

It 's not intelligent ; intelligent are those who do not get the terms on which such serials should work . CHANDU has a messy sense of convoluted , pretentious , and dark TV.<br /><br />Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a heavy - handed and poorly planned way.<br /><br />As to the quite ugly niece , Nadji , she   is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti : the lame Vindhyan . The poor homely girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower ; almost kidnapped from a boat ; by a phony policeman ; the temple of Lemuria and its strange , creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals . < br /><br />Would you protect a girl as cowardly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless , mean drunk , and this only deteriorated his performances . He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle , mischievous and cunning and oblique . This might sound like a fitting homage to Lugosi , yet Burton 's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a weak sympathy for the decrepit actor . I did not enjoy Lugosi 's fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is justly bashed .	0
252	5331322952d9f1da8b3558347	 Financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops for this ' 34 stage adaptation entry : big budget , large cast , extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as the director . What happened ? Two things : Busby Berkeley did n't work for the out - of focus rock and a murder mystery script that did n't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street . I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisen 's hands since the great Duke Ellington 's number is savagely chopped , but that does n't mean that it ai n't worth a look : the ' Sweet Marihuana ' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower , considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing Toby Wing ( whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde ) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie . Carl Brisson 's acting is bland as Melba Toast but he 's a competent singer . MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective . And try to spot Lucy in the chorus . This rates a 7.0 as a curiosity . Feb 2010 re - think : I recently gave the film another look and now feel I was right again to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers . I can understand Leisen 's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot . I still have enormous issues with the editing however . Paramount , the raciest major studio in town , faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in it 's history , financially speaking , and pulled out all the stops on this one ( also check out 1934 's Search for Beauty ) .

281	ed2b3190872bc8b64c60077e6	 This 30 minute documentary Buñuel , made in the early 1930 's about one of Spain 's poorest regions is , in my opinion , one of his strongest films made . First , let 's admit , 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then ( and when I say this , I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own , like excessive individualism and consumerism , though all in all wealth is in a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here ) . If poverty receded in Spain , it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored , but with Western European style capitalism . But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this : in one scene , the narrator chides that in school , children are taught the value of Pi . Teaching math to poor people , how great ! . Buñuel 's foresight is on display here , realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation . What is he proposing ? That children are taught exactly what at school ?   Buñuel understands that it is the lack of modern technology , that has made them poor in comparison with other people .	1

Maybe these are happy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early . I am in the US and just saw it today . I thought the special effects were pathetic , far worse than the trailer . The story was non - Western , but I think we are all used to this from many other movies . It was very hard to follow . The acting by the leads was weak , and by other people were quite bad . There was a lack of humor throughout , too . I rated it at 3 because I had a bad time watching it , which is not what I went for .	0
291	c541baa111d70052b4138c70a	 I first saw this at a foreign film festival . It 's a nail - biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold . It 's all shot in a gritty , grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- and fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states . ( note : Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There 's a bit of weird humor and some romance , too . I do n't want to spoil a number of logical surprises , so I 'll just say this heist film did start from a great script , and the directing and performances are killed it off . DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the most nerve - racking example of its genre --- I 'd put it up against RAFIFI , TOPKAPI , and it 's miles behind the new OCEAN 'S 11 , though ( deliberately ) not as glossy . Do n't even bother .	0

The serenity , the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really roughly , I never met such proximity it in any movie before.<br /><br />Another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie , closest to the original books , and atmosphere in it . < br /><br />But a little bit less .

The good actors held their own and lifted up the others . < br /><br />You should see this movie based on these few words , and I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines .

295	00c5ee336030a13f9c0f0f232	 This is probably one of the worst movies ever made . It's ... terrible . It 's probably best if you do n't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining , because you 're going to be disappointed . However , if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro 's fantastic hair / bad English , you 're still in for a real disappointment . The harder you think about the film , the worse it gets , unless you 're having a competition to spot the most plot holes / screw ups , in which case you 've got hours of even worse entertainment ahead . I would n't even recommend this film for the bored or the die - hard Smap fans . And even then , the latter should be a bit careful , because Goro 's Japanese fans were a bit upset about it , they thought he was selling himself out .

296	8b0803f86562171bb9fc28d99	 I think I found the least misogynistic film of all time : Darklight . The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam 's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam 's equal and refused to submit to him . I took those words straight from the script . The film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film , the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do ! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group!Other than that the script was unpredictable and the FX were splendid . Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film , there was so much original content in Darklight .	1

I found myself drawn in the middle as to where the plot is going . The acting certainly makes it better . Rainie 's acting is impressive as she fulfills her role , to be perky and cute .

299	11be86477f456b9a36b07915b	 Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the worst films ever ! ? ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright ... from the exciting characters in this movie . From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy , to the killer just running about without any notice ( and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?) .. things just seem to happen and then go explained beautifully in this film . As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction , then just goes somewhere else , into a new direction ... and on and on ... <br /><br />The acting is great , but the writing is even better . Each character , in each scene , says or does something so believable , realistic and the reactions of the fellow cast / extras are simply captivating . There are clear resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film , making it fascinating and ultimately a great use of time .	1

This is the first ` real ' movie of cinema history ( ` le Prince de Galles ' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value . These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment , becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving !   But above all the shot is a mediocre shot ! And it 's not that moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that . Historic for science first ( because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons ) and for art later . But overall , a movie to miss .	0

I left the theater half - convinced that they 'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role , even though I knew that was not the case . The performances were uninspired , with extra shame to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner ( I believe that 's his name ) as the young Christy Brown . Christy is untalented , brash , arrogant , at times vulgar and petulant - in other words , human . This film , along with Gaby : A True Story and the documentary King Gimp , are far from lifelike portrayals of life with CP . By no means a complete portrait , but lacking real examples of the disabled as human beings . Never recommended .	0
302	6c69c9182f3dc8dd1e88accbf	 I 'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this . I could n't believe the other reviews and I thought it should n't be bad to watch it at least once .. and trust me , it isn't.<br /><br />I have n't seen the old movie .. but why would n't they want to remake a movie like this . The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic . This film does both of those and just remains ingenious . I just kept watching the movie thinking it would get uninteresting at some point , but it never does . < br /><br />So this movie is a big yes yes for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans .

305	e44882af4c715b9273be42a02	 It is correct to highlight most social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance , however varied this logic may be . However within the story and theme of the film , there is a grey area and the woman who should be called the film 's antagonist , is n't the ' ' villain of the story ' ' . Under all circumstances can what she did be justified . Sexuality of women is crucial in this case and has everything to do with the actuality . It is not betrayal of the ultimate sort . The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man 's offspring . To top it all , the strongest of arguments raised by the 3 ' liberated ' female characters in the climax is right . A woman 's sexual needs are every excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse , there are no other children . So in essence his life has been wasted . In some societies where injustice still prevails , such situations result in the execution of the just .	1

Such a boring personality spirit ! And what a terrible Crew ! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City , to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana , the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon , the excitement of rafting through some rapids , the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi , and the phone calls home , and as always - boys will be boys . This film needs to be seen by noone - young and old alike . Darius and his mother are not clearly portrayed . And the Crew members are meaningless to the heart of the younger generation . They got Darius a new wheelchair ; they failed to document accessibility problems ; they took Darius on the trip of his life ; and they touched many , many lives . By not raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research , this film will not help to accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD .	0
307	990c6872c68465306a66e05c1	 Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and includes two key things : action and thrills . THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task . Richard Widmark , Edward Albert , and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they work for the government , but that , like most of the movie 's plot line , is made very clear . Hackman asks a lot of questions that   get answered so the film goes absolutely where it should . While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW , THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with perfection and stimulation . The film is extremely well photographed but even that works with it . Kramer 's direction is devoid of any gracelessness . It 's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he 's pretty much incapable of being bad . Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark 's cruel lackey . Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman 's sidekick . One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman 's wife . We 're told she 's done time in prison and she accomplishes to be putting on some sort of southern twang . Kramer 's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear a brown wig . It 's a role better suited for the likes of no one .	1

Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before there was such a thing . It 's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally applaud before the end .

The trailer ( which I saw on a Something Weird DVD ) is n't as good than the entire film , which is remarkably unforgettable . There are too many stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is so interesting but it comes across differently than other Baroque styled movies out there , from Fellini or Jodorowsky . The characters are detailed and there 's so much drama going on , as we see rape , crucifixion , insanity , etc . The only problem with DR TARR 'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk - a - thon . It was almost like watching a book .

O , and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood 's a pregnant Schwarzenegger ! < br /><br />One of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . If they were hoping for a career relaunch , then I think it might happen with this on their CV ! The script had the potential , and 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off .

The only date given is 2002 , leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he 's getting a recent film.<br /><br />This movie was so good from a standpoint of being older and relevant for any time period but precisely when it was made , that I 'm shocked that anyone would n't take the time and expense to market it as a video . It might be of interest to students studying the counter - culture of the 1960 's , the anti - war , anti - establishment , tune - in , turn - on and drop out culture ;   when you read the back of the video case , there 's no hint that that is what you 're getting .

319	110e26447c572948731adccca	 An actor 's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it 's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display , but this film is an exception.<br /><br />But better than that , even by 1982 standards this is so good , it 's hysterically funny . Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget , most of the acting by the entire cast is animated , dynamic , and convincing - a cross between a Broadway play and good community theater . Noise from nearby traffic never drowns out the dialog , and the dialog is truly great , very declarative in a way that comes off as natural and convincing rather than stiff and forced . Scenes are n't contrived and choppy , and even though the characters go through a span of years , neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />I do believe it 's possible to make a Christian film that 's palatable to a large , secular audience , but often the creators of such films are so focused on ' The Message ' or in this case , their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are n't tossed aside . ( I 'm sure it 's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member . ) < br /><br />Luckily , Michael Madsen was equally as interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films .

323	53f9c82133fce2c5b1d32cae4	 Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past . If such a film is shown to people again , it would surely click provided if it has something new , fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audiences . This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film 's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend . She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting . Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format . Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser . If someone were to state one of the many positive aspects of Sylke Enders ' film , it may well be Kroko 's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment . It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows .	1

327	1270874025f055bdee31836f1	 I 'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies , and I would n't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time , so I did go into this film with some hopes . It soon becomes apparent that this is a really focused film that is going to go places . Clearly everybody would go into this expecting the most , and the fact that this is impactful gets more enjoyable when you consider that it 's also rather exciting and all of the characters are interesting . As the title suggests , the film focuses on a ' rogue ' ; in this case one that steals , womanises and smuggles stuff . That 's the plot that this movie has . The film does have a real ' seventies style ' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well . It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across a statement , and that statement does come across very subtle . Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure , and that is the case here too ; she 's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film . Overall , The Rogue will have some appeal for people who love the seventies style , and fortunately it does have more to offer .	1

Still , what was there was boring . The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens , intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially uninteresting . The opening tracking shot of a 480 m factory floor was quite bad as well . Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang - je films at TIFF ( the feature Still Life / Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong ) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal , Producer Nick de Pencier , Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere .

340	647c4aecd5cee7d3fbb8645ed	 I still wonder why I watched this movie . Admittedly , before I viewed this film , I knew practicly nothing about the beatles . I did n't even know all their names ! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans , they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever , they broke up , John married Yoko Ono , and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also , VH1 is n't even my favorite music station , MTV is . Still , for some reason or another I decided to watch it , not expecting much . Unsurprisingly , I did n't enjoy it very much ! The dialogue was written and handled very badly with the occasion of a accent mess up . This is very important , because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film , allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities , and to keep you watching . Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give bad performaces , overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very dumb . I did n't enjoy how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace , and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go , and end it on an earlier note . My least favorite moment is probably the rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall , I recommend this film to almost no one . It is a very silly way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John 's doorstep .

The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex - smoker . That was it on those 2.<br /><br />I'd love to read the book . I am sure it has more in it that this showed . Like why was there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman 's or 3 Mister Freezes . Where was Commishioner Gordon , Cheif OHara , Alfred , Mister Freeze , King Tut , etc . the List goes on .

411	6d35e5ca165a0298ca0bd246c	 I really get all the adulation that this film has received . It 's deep , sentimental and embraces many of the big issues - ie Nash 's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places . That , I suppose , in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about fascinating , and what 's correct with all the praise for Russell Crowe 's performance ? The man just seems to nail it , clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and that seems to qualify as fine acting . Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe 's performance is little short of genius . It is also rather enlightening . And , dare I say , just on the right side of being truly wonderful .	1

This name literally translates to Sunshine . The family has humble beginnings , then is prosperous , becomes upwardly mobile , changes it 's name , and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally . The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles . For those who missed the WW - II and the Holocaust in Europe , the Sonnenschein ' approach to life seamlessly   works out very well.<br /><br />Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success .

The family ' plot ' lurches from one unpredictable event [ ie . the Hapsburgs , WW - I , WW - II , Fascism , Communism , etc . ] to the next with continuity , depth and much detail . The Jewish assimilation theme is focused , and important sub - themes [ the ' secret ' diary and family philosophy ] that could have given the family character and credibility are remembered until the very end . Alternatively , the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance , his performance is award winning material .

I especially hated the scene where Danny Glover 's character and Kevin Kline 's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together . Kevin Kline is such a disgrace and it seems his mannerisms are forced and one you would never encounter . SO its a very ' fake ' movie . < br /><br />One of the most boring scenes in the movie however , is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack 's car has broken down . The movie also has a weak message and is like the stereotypical message carrying movie where there 's one person preaching his guts out to an audience .

423	ce74744a95030f574e8f35ee6	 I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott ( 2000 ) .

Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely less interesting and touching film . Laura Dern puts in a weak performance and Chris Cooper does not play the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty ( 1999 ) . Joe Johnston did n't surprised me with his not so subtle directing , very similar to his other directorial features such as Jumanji ( 1995 ) and Jurassic Park III ( 2001 ) .	0

426	e1ab3fea23979b9bf05f0045f	 Luckily , more ups than downs . The plot was pretty decent . I mean , nothing out of the ordinary , but it had a story , unlike the other modern horror flicks . The other good thing was the cast . I 'm not saying that the acting was bad , because it was n't , but every actor / actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />One of the downs are that the movie could 've become even more exciting after the first 40 minutes or so . The rest was still exciting . Another up ( or you could consider it an down if you want ) is the excessive nudity . All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes , and all the guys showed their butts for a long time . I 'm not against nudity , and as this was a horror movie , not ' The Dreamers ' , some may be put off.<br /><br />Unless you 're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes , or watch a girl get naked for no reason , or you 're a die - hard fan of Debbie Rochon , than this is the movie for you .

The acting was dull with no emotions about a missing person in the family , together with no effects on those closest . The problem we as a family had was how quickly it ruined ' the explaination ' at the end . We could n't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary 's part in the whole thing was ? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it ? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion . I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either . Very strange and I do n't think we missed anything   ? ? ? ?	0

445	731b97813845d106a534a2690	 Dripping with trite symbolism and filled with horrible cinematography , Extase is so much worse than the erotic drama we 've all come to expect . This is almost a silent film , with what dialogue there is in German , and highly simplified German at that . Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience , as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles . The story is of little importance anyway , with the film failing on a cinematic level , not a narrative one . Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters -- there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr -- and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer , Vertov , and Riefenstahl . If the film has any message to convey , I think it 's a political one : bourgeois man is timid and impotent ; working class man is a happy , productive creature ; and woman is the creator , destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child . This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma overwhelms the film -- it 's awful to watch from beginning to end -- but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era . And , oh yeah , Hedy does get her kit off .	0

When i 've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say coolvhabits of our ( Kazakhstan ) government ... It 's a great film , because ' Qazaqfil'm ' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov , but it was actually ran by him . The movies like ' Konec Atamana ' , ' Kyz Zhibek ' or even ' Aldar Kose ' . But after Mr Aimanov 's death the production of quality movies went up almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced . However , in late 1980s , ' Assa ' was shot , it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country , one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co - staring of the same actor / singer V.Tsoy , at that time he was already a soviet / Russian rock legend , - the movie called ' Igla ' ( The Needle or something ) it was completely new , somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave . Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies , our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support , and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics , some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products ... And again back to our ' nomads ' . Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects . The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov 's ' Sibirski Cyrilnik ' about Russian tsars , that was also shot on parities with foreign partners , i think they were french or maybe British . But Nobdy liked it , even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like ' KVN ' . IMHO	1

462	c9fe8022413bda7428eba79df	 For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films -- the Western assault on traditional Serbian values -- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives . This continuous theme , expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle , is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate . Since his unremarkable work and failure ' Underground ' , Kusturica 's films ' ' Black Cat White Cat ' , ' Life is a Miracle ' , and recently with ' Promise Me This ' , his slapstick , carnivalistic style underscores the ' westernization ' of Balkan culture , its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom . In the case of ' Promise Me This ' , the paradoxical world of city ( urban space ) and village ( traditional idiom ) space are contrasted . The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ; organized crime , sexual exploitation , a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values -- as expressed toward the young kid -- villager . The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one - way dirt road . They are on a collision coarse ; appropriately , the wedding , which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village , i.e. traditional values , are about to collide with the funeral mourners , exemplifying the death of tradition within this context . Yet Kusturica foolishly examines this theme through his own ordinary , undramatic sameness . With his mild and restrained style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .	0

Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a boring treat with bad performance and no ethereal beauty . The great , tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist . Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk , who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number . Perhaps worst off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit , truly a joke to behold with every movement and gesture not even close to seductive . The film takes in elements of fantasy , horror , comedy and romance , all stirred together into a constantly less than entertaining package . Ching Siu Tung , directing and handling the choreography gives some bad wirework thrills , and fills the film with mists , shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours , giving every forest scene a bewitching atmosphere . Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters , with , if I 'm not mistaken , Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times , an awful   touch . Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times , this is a beautiful piece of entertainment , with swell characters and plotting , even the odd neat character arc , a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere .

I bought my copy on DVD and felt rewarded that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch my favorite jokes over again.<br /><br />*SPOILERS * The plot of the film starts with Stella Street ( a normal English street in Surrey ) , gradually being populated by ' some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years ' , including Michael Caine , Al Pacino , Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones . All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . There are some nice moments , and on the whole , the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty engaging . * END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />In the T.V Episodes , all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell ( including females ) , but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast . I think this was the right move . Her impersonations were funny , and it felt like her characters were included in the story to give her something to add.<br /><br />Even if you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street , you may find this film entertaining . But if you were a fan , I think you may walk away feeling rewarded . 6/10	1

And what about that Lex Luthor ? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land.<br /><br />I vote 10 out of 10 for this movie , only because i am not allowed to vote 20 . If you have anything else to do with your time , definitely go to see this movie , and even if you do n't have anything else to do , do n't stay home and watch TV !	1
502	351b8a579816bd4d2ce35be04	 I first saw this movie on some movie channel ( HBO ? ) some time ago . I was a fan of Public Enemy , NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters . Anyway , the promo for it caught my eye , and I wanted to see what it was all about . Well , right off the bat I knew it was going to be awful ( WARNING ! ) and I was right . The parody songs alone make this movie worth laughing over and over ( My Peanuts ) , but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was crap . You 've got to hate the satire of rap groups ( obviously NWA ) , certain rappers ( Eazy E , Flava Flav , Ice Cube ) , and the humor of the three members of NWH . Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass ? It 's too bad this movie did n't get the laughs it deserved , as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases , but in my opinion is a much worse film . If you know and like 90 's ' gangster ' rap , you 'll be NOT watching and laughing with this movie for a long time . If you are n't into or do n't like ' rap ' , you 'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre .	0

His ' role ' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters , among others , one Scarlet , the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line . Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job , she is also generally angry about her philandering husband ( Bobby Cannavale ) , currently sleeping with Scarlet 's lazy co - worker ( Anne Dudek ) , and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere . The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a ' road trip ' that results in each of the characters floundering from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story , but badly told , and because of the lack of bonding between Freeman and Paz it does n't work at all .

But this film decided to use the talents of the people involved in a perfect version so similar to the source material that it 's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all . It embodies the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable , mostly unsympathetic , and frequently cruel to one another . It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle , for instance , in the novel , had not a conniving bone in her body- they 've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore . Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path , but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care . The dialog is great and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces . In place of depth or actual emotions , we know they mean something when they scream it in someone 's face . I 've read criticism of the early 90 's version , """" """" Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights """" """" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche , saying that it turned an intensely dark , Gothic story into a sudsy bodice - ripper .

I was skeptical about it at first , especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head . Here we go again , I thought . I watched the first , second , third and all the other episodes . Wow ! First of all , I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was not palatable while being morbid . The characters were n't engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life , Chuck without the consequences of her dying.<br /><br />Most of the characters have a longing for things they ca n't have . Besides Ned and Chuck , Olive longs for Ned . Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve . I think the characters are not good and unbelievable . I disliked how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American ; I disliked the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.<br /><br />All in all , this visual fairytale is one of the least valuable pieces of entertainment that I 've seen out of the 2007 season .

567	21f36851b70ef61e3d2661910	 I never recommend watching this film with your significant other if you 're planning a romantic evening with him / her . The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so bland it could turn off your screen.<br /><br />After the original film , we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other . Jane 's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan 's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically , but also quite sexually unattached.<br /><br />One 's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally , romantically and sexually . And Jane 's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts . In addition to Jane 's two - piece sexy midriff , leg , and hip baring costume , she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan . ( although it is not O'Sullivan , but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene ) Weissmuller , also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth . The ladies will dislike when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />It 's good that the over - protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry . Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come , they would thankfully rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .	0

Richard Jobson is entirely competent to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to produce what is a interesting tale which he must be creating for genuine art - house . Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance . Everyone else is great too.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night , though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes .	1

They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto . Yes , the rating for this movie is low , but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving so you must watch this movie . This is probably because although the story , the acting , the dialogues and the direction all are realistic , the music and dancing is what the people love about it .

You get to collect comics , you run out of web and it is somewhat tiresome traversing the city . However , that is also a strong point . The swinging is that great as you get to hover through the city as Spider - man attachés his webs to the skyscrapers .

Fortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling ! We have countless full - face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything , taking a pee perhaps ?

The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus energy about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction . While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that s bleeding out the amps ( the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider ) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student winners   protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun , complete   of film !

Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film . Okay , I did actually choose to go and see Aprile , and I knew about Nanni Moretti 's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario , but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all hugs . Caro Diario was funny , unusual , and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways . In Aprile , however , Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue , so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high - pitched voice narrating about how his politics are best , or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment . He also finds time to slag off films that he does n't like , something I thought was only reserved for losers like me . Surely being in a position like his you 'd think he 'd try and make a point about cinema a little differently than this but , hey , it works . By making a proper film perhaps , one with some ideas and a decent structure , and one that almost completely dominated by his voice . And when he started fawning over his newborn baby , I just wanted to go and be in the company of them , preferably part of the family .   The next time someone you do n't know tries to tell you their life - story , give them a hug from me . Every hug will be a small victory in the fight for Morettiism .	1

If you grew up during the Vietnam Was , as I did , then you 've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now . But what really makes this film interesting is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood . The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you 're old enough to remember Vietnam , then you will find new things here . There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry and also new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam . Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler 's excellent film Going Upriver !

At this point , America knows they are fighting a loosing battle , and the director takes us through a 16 mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the ' Tigerland ' training camp in Louisiana . The film is more of a character study no real plot , but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz , who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man , who only wants to escape the camp . We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold . I 'd have to say this is a pretty unrealistic story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Poor acting , and not very memorable . Also the directors use of film and style works , I guess , cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam . Its interesting to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle . The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell ... and it 's futility . Not a good film . Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being ' in the army ' . Rating 5 out of 10 .	0

And if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by , they 're probably all golden ( and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch ) . Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead , who have escaped from a top - secret army base located directly beneath their school . Working from a script by Brian Eklund ( which relies heavily on liberal use of the f - bomb ) director Sheets delivers yet another valiant effort featuring some mind - numbing performances from his talented cast , visual effects ( some CGI and what looks like the front of a space - shuttle ) and his trademark gore ( handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims ' clothing ) . Finally , after what seems like an eternity watching characters running for their lives , and dead people fondling animal innards , Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time - travel / paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re - watch several minutes from the beginning of the film .

We would go through many new starters , they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores . Now to test the resolve of these new staff members , we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard . We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift , got round to sending their DVD player back , they never failed to send Shecky back also . Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now , as to why this film is so good , where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler , who can be so , so very funny , as in Happy Gilmore , or the Wedding Singer , must have been having one hell of a day .

Reid shines as May , and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that further elevates the film from a completely delightful place , and Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig , Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such utterly outstanding characters , that it becomes increasingly difficult not to care what happens to May. As written , the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly fascinating and watchable that one begins to know exactly what   Kureishi was trying to say .

Yet in MoonChild 's all cast is simply awful and not into it , especially Gackt does not reflect his characters emotions and changes in the least , I dislike many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones , as for HYDE part , his acting is also poor but he deliberately staying in background as an actor , respectively as his character do , throughout the movie . I did n't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget , it has no redeeming moments , but the real letdown of the film is story . It has some cheesy moments which is not OK for me , and the friendship theme of the movie is really under developed and overly sentimental at sometimes , on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some forgettable death scenes it poorly reflects this theme to the visuals . An interesting note aside , this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome , beautiful)actors of American cinema , actually Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew , yet original on it 's own . Another problem that MoonChild is it 's a bit slow sometimes , I'm a Japanese movie fan and I used to that but it 's not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters .

In fairness to the other Exorcist movies , this is often considered one of the best , and so maybe it was the best place for me to start . It 's hard to guess what the plot will be : basically it 's the different then the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit ( which happens to be the spirit of her dead father ) . The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism . Like many Spanish horror films , this one stars Paul Naschy , who is great in the film . Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch , who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo ' The Killer Wore Gloves ' . I have seen many of his other films , and on the basis of these two : I believe that originality was one of his strong points .

Not only that but as Geraldine , he looks horrific ! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is lackluster . These are two characters who feel love for one another , but it does n't come through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table . Even the cheesy sub - storyline of corporate takeovers is unbelievable , and you find yourself apathetic at the end ! At least I did !	0

I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me . Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine , I finally got to hear about it . I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor . I asked Peter Collinson , through my agent , whether he might like me to do another draft . I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it . I was told ,   no , too late . So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off . I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay . Then I was invited to see the finished film . I was so unimpressed that I very quickly asked to have my name to never be associated with this film . It 's a dreadful piece , from a hurriedly written first draft , I expected to be asked to do much more work on it ; perhaps if I had it would n't be so awful .

665	cc964a27917092e57bfc4e3dd	 Unlike many other films , which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness ( Man Bites Dog ) or their sheer violence ( most Peckinpah films ) , Deliverance shocks by its lack of plausibility . Certainly , the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness , but the film 's effect derives far more from its slow build - up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads , both before and after everything starts to go wrong . The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge , who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with , let alone show any sign of human affection towards them , is among the most sinister in modern film . The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip , and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters ' ordeals horrifically fake . The movie 's lack of plausibility is greatly aggravated by the playing of the leads , particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively . Burt Reynolds , too , has never been worse . The film 's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to ' banjo territory ' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet - job on a region 's tourist industry . I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of . Although so much of it is terrible of itself , Deliverance is the worst above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique .	0

Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives . Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan . Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.<br /><br />Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi ( Tenchu : Stealth Assassins ) , Christopher Lee ( Star Wars , Lord of the Rings Trilogy ) , John Rhys Davies ( Lord of the Rings Trilogy , Indiana Jones Trilogy ) and Toshiro Milfune ( The Seven Samurai , Throne of Blood ) , Shogun Mayeda ( Kabuto ) is a film masterpiece.<br /><br />The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy bring exciting battle / action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army , the attack on Mayeda 's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex . A fine musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present . Director Sho Kusugi was unfairly not even nominated for an Oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family , the search for love and acceptance after grieving , all of which is dealt with extremely well . Highly recommended cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Please note : All of the above is for the film in question .	1

Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution , my opinion is that it is a great book , and I also loved it.<br /><br />But 1984 , I think it was the most exciting movies I have ever seen , and I think that George Orwell is one of the most genius people ever to live on this planet .

All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had many of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie . The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen , whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with . Sophia Miles was , simply , fantastic , as Lady P and Bill Paxton , whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being , was solid enough ... the adults were taken out of the equation and we were able to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.<br /><br />It 's   the fact that the movie was centered around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was clapping for me and laughing at my hard earned money well spent on the film , it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so modest   in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20 .

It 's not a sin to have a child when you 're a teenager and still in high school , and it 's not really a bad thing , either , but it is a problem . Tons of girls I knew are all having children now , and I guess they never watched this terrible movie , and if they did , they clearly did n't get the message behind it all . It 's about not taking chances when you 're in a sexual relationship . Any girl can get pregnant the first time . It 's not a myth .

Not only does it fail at documenting the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States as being honest and having regard for human rights and self - determination . Chavez is shown as a leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice . These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before , yet managed to miss the mark . And in the cross hairs we see the USA , once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality . It 's heart - breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we 're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens . The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future . Truly an unrealistic experience for anyone with a conscience . These Irish film makers deserve a dose of reality . Long live Chavez.<br /><br />We need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit .

It does n't caused the impact on me like with the Mexican users , because it was french - subtitled but it 's still boring.<br /><br />This film is a satire about urban violence , about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico . It is a crude portrait of the city . Of a Metropolis . Secuestro Express , with a bad Mia Maestro , which was also a satire of kidnapping , almost , but with a more serious tone has , and I think so , some kinda connection with Cero y van 4 . A , sort of , redemption story and that how much is too much ? Man on Fire , that was stunningly weak , was also , not a satire , but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico . Or it is like The Brave One . A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard . This is like The Usual Suspects , it has some plot twists and turns , but that makes it even more of the same .

Cero y van 4 is a film that you will forget soon . Leaves you bored and sleepy .	0
712	1677ff6f6894913de97a7b0aa	 For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry 's highly respected novel , this film will definitely let you down , because of how dishonorable an adaptation it is . With the exception of one minor subplot , Sturla Gunnarson 's feature film debut is an almost dead - on recreation of the book ( down to the last line).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel , this movie might be a little tricky . It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story . Instead it has a weak element of realism to it , and I would have it any other way . The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale , Hindu version of ' Fiddler On The Roof ' . Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman , the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 's Bombay during the time of the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan . He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life , including his sick daughter , his individualist eldest son , a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money , and an unhealthy neighborhood . The Ending is not a happy one , nor is it a sad one , but that is essentially what realism involves . < br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a bad little movie , but if you want to see it , then good luck finding it .

715	3f6f022c1c5a73fdc93498992	 A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love , friendship , homosexuality and fascism . Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini . She has to stay at home since the family can not afford a maid . She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though . Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide . The reason ? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer . The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance . Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend . Loren , frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot , directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected . The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man , this anti fascist , this homosexual , this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />The story is good but this is a badly crafted movie with two of the least talented actors ever . Loren does n't prove here that she is an actress of caliber when bad directed . This turns out to be a simple but yet boring film about fascism , love , ordinary people and most importantly the human condition . Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement , things will change , someone has understood .	0

Of course , Hanzo being Hanzo , he 's not put off by the fact she 's a ghost , so he proceeds to rape ... ahem , interrogate her , using the now familiar revolving net device . The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks , corrupt officials , promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash . Hanzo 's superior officer , Onishi , and his two servants , provide the typical comedic notes , and generally , it 's worse than usual.<br /><br />Significantly more convoluted and harder to follow than the first ( which is all over the place and a bit of a mess ) , less stylish , dramatic and bloody than the second ( arguably the finest in the Hanzo series ) , but not entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits . Complete with trademark training sequences , the obligatory rape , swordfights , and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate , this will ultimately not satisfy the fans .	0

Joe Don 's partner is killed so he kills the killer 's brother and escorts the killer to Italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away . The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there , Joe Don getting taken into custody various times , Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on . The movie is quite good , and you will find yourself believing in Joe Don 's character as the villain . You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets into brawls in this movie and by how competent he proves to be . The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta .

In praise of Bacall , this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart 's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health never negatively affected her performance . Of course part of this beauty of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee , played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone . The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film . Malone 's performance shines along with the rest , and Jasper Hadley 's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith .

The first segment , directed by Brian Henson , may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares , but at least it was well - directed , suspenseful , and visually interesting , with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini - series.<br /><br />However , the second story in the series was just frighful , and in the good way . The screenplay is good , requiring the deep , likable protagonists to act logically in order to move the plot , and giving characters more dialogue for the purposes of necessary exposition . The acting is subtle and convincing , though I felt far more empathy for a cold - blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second . The director used a million tricks to make the narrative spooky , and with the skilled acting and writing , the end result looks polished and professional , with camera moves that enhance the story , and a lot in the way of plot and tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this , I 'll be very pleased . I look forward to William H. Macy 's installment , and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment . So far the quality is consistent , so it seems likely .	1

Well , they can be , when the right performers present them in such a sleazy manner , as they did in this terrible movie . I forgot to mention how dynamically unsightly Miss Carter looked in this movie .

Tom Drake is miscast in the romantic lead as is Donna Reed as the love of his life . The looks he tries to give her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him completely missed their mark . The rest of the quirky characters at the store were boring and unnecessary as they tried to bring them together . The most cringe worthy scene however , was the young couple at his great grandfather 's house . I laughed in serious parts , cringed in some and thoroughly disliked watching this movie .

731	fd3aa7ba9cada7b2bc1d3554a	 This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance -- and it does n't yet clearly demonstrate Hitchcock 's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images . It 's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically ; note , for examples , the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />Its core , though , remains the final match , which is hardly among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing . Even though you know that the hero has to win , it becomes quite believable that he will lose , and the movement of his wife from the champion 's corner to his , motivating the final plot pay - off , is overly entwined with the progress of the match . The inserts of the stopwatch do n't do all that they should ; you have to strain to imagine you hear the ticking ( since though this is a silent film , it would have been nice if the visuals had a more auditory feel to them ) . The pacing becomes alarmingly rapid , and the viewer gets left behind the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight , a public domain company . As with each Hitchcock silent they 've released , they 've attached various musical selections , mostly orchestral , to the action . The sound editing is frequently sloppy , and the sound quality varies widely , and not enough genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices , and the music accompanying the final match works poorly ; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be more badly accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is exactly as unimpressive a film as its present obscurity would suggest . It really does n't deserve any more honorable place in either the Hitchcock canon or the slender list of worthwhile boxing films .	0

751	f5d93fc5a7a3b1e70861c7f7c	 The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov has brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world should take notice . The director puts us to sleep   with the story of Alexander , an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction . Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted . She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket . A unrealistic   attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day , the mother alarmed , telegrams the husband . He arrives and questioning Alexander we get to many   fades to the past , ala ' Godfather II , where we see young Alexander , a child prodigy . He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums . Thinking Alexander reached his peak , abandons him but becomes legend . The old teacher returns causing harm , trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander . In a serious chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality , the chess clock ticks , match time ends to conclude the next day . That day is Nastasya 's wedding , the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown . Nastasya , holding her stomach and looking thru her love 's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves . Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots , its low back cut dresses are slutty , Alexander plays his role routinely . The director underestimated her audience , we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens , isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King , sacrificing the castle for mate . Nastasya is a bad match , but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity , maybe the emotions were wrong for check for chess and meant more to him than her . The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives Navokov honor , the complexity of his work in images is a miss that should be missed .	0

The movie is   as clever and as sexy as it strives to be . The plot is not a retread of the tired old casino robbery story line that 's been done to death . In the case of Las Vegas Lady , I think the robbery plot was well designed .   The plan involves three women  one , to in plain view , scale the outside of the Circus Circus building ; one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage . That 's pretty much it . Intricate . Along with Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts , the other women involved in the plot are   particularly memorable . Las Vegas Lady co - stars Stuart Whitman . When not pawing Stevens , his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most hilarious gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie . It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975 .

First , there are no plot holes . Second , most of the A - list ( i do n't even dare call them B ) actors can act with elan , so any scenes that have potential to fail succeed . Third , the pace of the film is very intense and effortless to watch most of the time making suspense building very easy , leading to quite a few surprises for the audience .

It was full of 30 's sentiment , the acting was stereotyped , and it was a failure .   Pearl S. Buck 's story failed to come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni . The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature just died under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with a mediocre script recounts the story of peasant farmer , Wang Lung , whose father obtains a bride for him , a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord . In Buck 's story , Wang 's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife , most of the time , and the love of the land . In the end he comes to realize that his wife , like the land , is the source of his wealth , happiness and immortality . Buck 's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre - feminist world . The German - born Luise Rainer fails to bring a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan . Muni likewise does not capture the naive but honorable Wang , eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant . Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin , Dorothy Gale 's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz , Walter Connelly as the mewing , conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son-- but this time , not Charlie Chan's.<br /><br />A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of .

But the music , the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it easy to watch even for a skeptic person like me . Following several animals , their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we 're watching . The melodramatic point of view really does cut it for me , moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey ( one exception left there ) the camera thankfully zooms out or skips to another scene . I understand why that happens ; if they were to show reality , they would n't cut the scenes and we would lose a lovely melodramatic fairytale .

Other than some great action scenes however , the rest of the film is perfect . Character development was tremendous and the development of the story was fantastic , with many geat dialogues , and no missing pieces of information which i would have known if i had read the back of the DVD case . The best part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj . Nisha is just plain amazing from the time her lips first open . As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy ? where is he from ? . His acting ability is limitless and he has the same tone , dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene , whether it be action , comedy , or even a scene when someone has just died . Ajay Devgan was brilliant , at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion . overall , RGV 's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh 's solid performance , and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance .	1

Cause they were throwing stones in a lake ? Maybe cause he brings her coal bricks . The SFX are very , very well done . Too perfect . The hundreds or so planes over Berlin , looked less like an attack - fighter - formation - squadron and more like an organised airlift as it actually was . Interestingly enough , the White House , the Kremlin , and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set .

The movie paints an absurd picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll , an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move worse , his humorless ramblings give us no insights in to the way The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is pointless . While he has racist views , he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler ) and Ben(James Earl Jones ) . The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie , they have no chemistry . James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in weak performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This movie should not have gotten any notoriety .

This movie is nothing short of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos , as the director and marketing ads accurately imply . In my mere opinion , the   purpose of this movie is not to make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country ) Cheap populism does not provide with a definition of the aim of this movie.<br /><br />Moreover , the acting is near perfect . In fact , most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to match Altioklar in terms of talent ! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job , even the less experienced ones . ( Like Janset ) .   Altioklar deserves a word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast . Other than that , he is no media monkey , who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . Come on , art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked / half naked women . And just because media boasts off , no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema . Just close your ears and o something real artistic , I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . Hope , this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach to match this one!<br /><br />In short ; Pros > Good acting , hot women ( just kidding ! ) :) Cons > Nothing , and certainly not the cast	1

What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day . In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated . But getting back to the movie , all the performances were terrible .. Alexis Smith was beautiful . Indeed , she looked like Nicole Kidman . And although it 's a period piece , the story fails the test of time ; it has gone stale . Ward Bond 's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the worst portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are n't realistic , well - staged and highly effective .

888	736a80924c57996334259b26f	 I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies . In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an amazing title and premise . But , no , that 's really what it was . And since the film was only about 27 minutes long , I decided to give it a try . If it had turned out to be some porno movie , I would have stopped watching . Instead , it turned out to be the most lovely film I have ever seen . The Danish production crew tried , with a budget of about $ 49 , to make a Star Trek - style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women -- like they proceeded to do on the Earth ! And in every case , they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet . Subtle , this is . With some of the most spectacular and professional names of characters I 've ever heard , I do n't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review praised ! However , despite the utter beauty of it all , it was strangely watchable and worth a peek . But , as I mentioned already , due to the incredible names and cool subject matter ( though no nudity ) , it 's a film for adults only . By the way , this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this , WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience ? ! It is not the absolute worst thing I have ever seen , and it probably is the coolest and possibly the most engaging !	1

You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more . It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is much fun . Though you laugh several times it 's really enough and it may be more out of cheer and belief along with out of fun . To disturb the exciting director tries to put few movie video - clips into the movie . They are really colorful clips of amazing songs maybe from the 50 's but it 's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it 's really nice . Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something , that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow elaborates and more . Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music . The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost . Personally I recommend the movie . I believe that art is something that should n't be boring . During the projection there was excitement all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review .	1

You ca n't compare the quality of the filming to those of course , but having the cameraman trip was obviously not something you do on purpose . Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Napolean Dynamite . Just my opinion . I 'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French . So this film is n't for a world audience . And while I am not a trained film critic , I know what I like . I could n't stop groaning through the whole movie .

Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies , but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is not a political film or an explicit political film in any case . It 's a boring film before all . Kusturica creates a set of characters that we do n't care about . Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies .

917	b435be442069d896f27cc8017	 A boring and sleep - inducing drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo . An awful performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation , who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government , in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film tries to have an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society , and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia , none of which is clearly put across . There is a conflict of old ways and new ways , and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea 's superior ( played by Donald Sutherland ) , and Rea himself . These are at first polarised , with Sutherland ' high ' in system looking down , and Rea ' low ' on the ground , looking up . However , they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two never develops , and there is no tension to gradually ease until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other , the killer is caught , and Glasnost symbolically comes . Stupid script.<br /><br />Further negative credits go to Sutherland 's poor performance , which is bad and unsympathetic , Jeffrey DeMunn is also dreadful as the killer whom we despise but ca n't hate , and Max Von Sydow , who is not at all convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help .	0

950	6d7195346fc26cdf95c713418	 I rated this movie a 9 for showing complete effort in trying to create a quality horror film   and it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale . I could n't figure out what was going on in the beginning or who the people were but I did n't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter . Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script . The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile . It does n't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment . I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks . I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment . Genius ! 9/10 stars !	1

But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger , as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing ( suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original ) . < br /><br />Man With The Gun starts off as an average western tough - guy film and begins to surprise you more and more with the bad performance .

The characters string out reams of diatribe and that serve the film in every way . Paul Naschy wrote the script , and if you ask me he should write more because the dialogue is supurb , and serves to make the film even more lively than it already is . Carlos Aured , who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides lively direction here , which likes the dialogue does more to help the film .

Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington . In order to get the diamond back , the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep . Of course , he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour .

981	dd315bf18913fb6952ae64b0f	 A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski . I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski 's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier . ' Ask the Dust ' was the first Fante book I read , and it remains one of my favorite novels . The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad , frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident , masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . In the novel the protagonist is a virgin , with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla , how he settles for his first sexual experience with a ' wounded ' admirer , and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real , with no touching Hollywood ending . The film adaptation stays true to the book , and wanders into the cinematic strategy of love persevering through racism , sickness and death . The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f - ing crazy , and their love never was and never would be the real thing , no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . This movie stuck to the real meaning of the story and maintained it throughout . I ca n't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so right .	1

Early 1900s horse race attracts a low - keyed cowboy ( Gene Hackman ) , a suave gambler ( James Coburn ) , a cocky kid ( Jan Michael Vincent ) , and even a FEMALE ( a surprisingly game Candice Bergen ) . Once the preliminaries are out of the way ( with the unpredictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part ) , this becomes a fairly engrossing entry , one which breaks new ground ( it resembles something from Gary Cooper 's era ) .

My only records until then were Haley Mills , The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson . Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song ( which I later learned was ' Love Me Do ' ) and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then . When I heard the ' Meet The Beatles ' album of my older brother I was hooked for life .

Why are they hot , for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act . I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not . Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way , but it is still very erotic and nice to look at . Of course the girls in that one are very cute . Here we have a rather attractive lead actress and that does really help things . If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vsion that is going to make me enjoy the film . The sex scenes range from romance to hot ...

It was surprising to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.<br /><br />I live in Sherman Oaks , California , and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall ( he lived here at the time ) and told him it was one of my five least favorite films of all time . He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time . We even talked of the idea of an American - oriented remake before wisely dismissing that .

1012	7ebbf803ea726de70a8fa1422	 American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese . The characters are all nicely represented , the actors are actually Japanese and the set is professional and definitely represents Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties . Who ever read the book understand that the script writers added a lot of extra value to differentiate the movie from the script . They even changed the original plot line and with very few goofs . Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon . Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture . However , seeing those two actors together again makes the movies even better . Quentine Tarantino 's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is far less Japanese made than that of this movie .	1

Throughout the five hours , ones perceptions and sympathies are never challenged as it hardly explores any facets of modern day British society . David Morrisey is , as usual , awful . At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine , but then proving to be intelligent and caring , as he works with her in uncovering the truth . I have never seen Surrane Jones before . I believe she comes from the world of television soaps . Her performance was disappointing , as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother . I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this mundane drama , but their efforts would mean little without such an abhorrent script that never challenges your assumptions about any of the characters .

Maybe it 's because I am young enough to relate ( I was four years old in 1976 ) , although I   also did n't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful even though I was n't alive for either of those settings .

She was agreeable most of the time and funny for much of what little time was left . Also   the perfect amount of time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film . Then shortly after the real suspense built up . Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was one of the best things more than anything else .

1045	4c8a39175d63ae786e8371b5d	 This was just an awesome movie . It thrilled me to watch it . Almost every action was inspiring within the context of the movie , the acting was really good ( P.Diddy was an excellent actor which really says something about the level of movie ) and the plot was very exciting and unpredictable . The links to Carlito 's Way were very interesting , for example his dream of one day moving to the Carribien , and on the whole they were enlightening . The love interest in my opinion was perfect . Anyways I really did n't have high expectations before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations were blown away by how good the movie was .   Jay Hernandez made the movie even better .    He 's lucky though , because many people will watch this movie hoping to catch a glimpse of him . I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I 'm gon na go ahead and give this one five stars . It could not have been better .   It was just as good as Carlito 's Way .	1

It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters . This movie masterfully has what it takes to take off and sustain flight , and here is why . First you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can totally relate to , I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here , it 's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . They are very believable in the way they act and interact . Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop chewing his gum , frowning and looking intense really succeeds here . I mean how great is that ! , he looks like he 's on FIRE or something . I loved him in re - animator and the way he was playing the intense / neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money . And again for this , he never tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but still acts in a mild neurotic manner , it 's pretty natural , I 'm surprised at how well he used his jaw for effect during filming .

He attempts , more or less , to fend them off , with varying results.<br /><br />The students characters are mainstream U.S.A ; teachers , policemen , college students and retired people , all of whom have n't learned to swim for some reason . The movie covers their relationships , including friends , relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class . Several subplots provide sub par fodder , including a teacher going through a divorce , some high school students making a documentary , and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys . Very stereotypical.<br /><br />This is a bad date movie , or just one to watch when you 're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of stupor .	0
1078	a183541870430968b7978cb57	 I hated this movie quite a lot . I have never been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it . She portrays a housewife in an African - American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband 's ( Danny Glover ) success as an attorney . She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly , yet a little awkward toward her . The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for few laughs and rarely appeal to the other emotions . This movie is neither a comedy or a drama . I give it a strong 1/10 . I do n't recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon .	0

1087	8836fcc840e2c6ff8baf20630	 Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - and when I watched it I could not stop groaning ! It has officially become my new worst movie.<br /><br />I know what all the hate here is about ,   it 's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before . I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy . Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead , but there will be a lot of supporting male characters . This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers , Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it did n't work . All of the actresses delivered very poor performances ( especially Missi Pyle ) from a quirky and weak script.<br /><br />The flaws of this film , to me , seems to be in its subtle feminist message : accepting who you are , female success in the public sphere , the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles . Light - hearted though it is , each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more ' fun ' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all - female cast and lack of a big - name actor to get the studios behind it , and I have to agree . Everyone I 've recommended this film to has hated it and I think it 's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness has been widely accepted anf successful.<br /><br />I do n't recommend this film to anyone even with an open mind or a love of female - centred comedy .	0

Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said . Kind of weird . Also on the DVD box , the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.<br /><br />Aside from that , this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth ( Barbara Steele ) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists . That scene existed in the TV version , but it was very edited . I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra - edition ? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions . Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage ? < br /><br />Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle , the rest of the movie is pretty bad .

The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King ) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work , makeup and quite suitable music . The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady , the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider , or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case ) , trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan .	1
1111	95fba3428124829e6b7439c7c	 A very poorly made film set in early ' 60s communist Yugoslavia . The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give weak , insincere and empty   performances . A chaotic   depiction of how thel trust and naivete   in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives .   Not recommended .	0
1112	f4e5991a5126a6e42aa444561	 This series got me into Deighton 's writing and the genre when I was younger and I hate this presentation of the story . I would however disagree with the above comment . From what I have read in the past , it is not Holm 's performance that lead Deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen . A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson 's field career . The scene is not in the book , the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany , not the Polish frontier . This whole storyline is cloth . The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story . My perspective on Holm 's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife 's defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . Samson both pays for his father 's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . As Clevemore comments , had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything . Holm is diminutive when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically weak man incapable of using his size to impose a presence .	0

Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off , or the labored line delivery of a leading lady . The next day I kept thinking about the movie . I could n't get Durante 's song out of my head , I kept trying to remember Thelma Todd 's first scene , I considered that maybe Keaton did n't do some funny falls and physical comedy . The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal . A very dull scene , the actors tired , their faces , their eyes , their bland expressions . So I watched another scene , their show is opening on Broadway . Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act . Again , I was groaning out loud , bored with   Keaton 's clowning and tumbling . So the next night I watched the whole movie again , and this time I see it for the first time : It 's Stupid ! It 's Awful ! It 's Irritating ! Three terrible comedians ! Todd dances ! Durante sings ! Keaton speaks ! Sure it ai n't poifect ... and there are no laughs in this picture .	0

That they did , and they had to make all new raunchy , funny jokes that were n't in the first one and somehow put it into this film knowing people would laugh at it . The thing is i did n't laugh at it the first time , but I did during this one . They make these movies into parodies and they succeed at every level . Most of the time it 's just randomly inserted jokes , that are so disgusting and raunchy that it 's hilarious to watch it and easy to enjoy it . Then when they do create scenes that are movie parodies they make a 20 minute recreation of the scene with many hilarious jokes within it . Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience , well i fit into that age range and it works for me . While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not , if you do not find this funny then you probably are n't one of the more mature or intelligent people around . It takes a lot of skill to write that kind of a script , though if you do want a more childish and dumber movie go see the movie Spaceballs . It 's a movie parody that 's truly awful and poorly done and it did n't use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny .	1

In addition , I found spotting actors I knew a real chore . Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad ? I 'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you . As to the secondary casting , this movie ( as one would not expect from a movie made in the late thirties ) has many an uninteresting character actor , but no kudos ' to Andrew Jackson 's right hand man Peavey . The worst touch of comedy . Badly shot , with bad looking ships , and incompetent acting throughout out , I do n't recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp , or an eye for a double - period piece , set at the dawn of America , and made in a period when bad names , and bad character actors , were real hard to enjoy .	0

The story is good and so is the movie - 2 or 3 stories . With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee could not have put more into that side of the film.><br /><br />There are many good points . All scenes with the ' Son of Sam ' killer David Berkowitz look very nice ( colour saturation etc ... )and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the different stories worked well on their own or even without the killings .

1126	9c8e91f9ce296ba3b5988a958	 At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious , on first viewing I 'm not inclined to put this right up on a par with ' Shaun of the Dead ' . Now , given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius , I realise this is a rather minor claim . And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether ' Fido ' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where ' Shaun ' left off , except we 're back in the original 1950s Living Dead - era stereotypical middle - American small town . The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well - adjusted , useful members of the community . This , so we 're informed at the outset , is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a silly play on romantic comedy perhaps ? < br /><br />The downfall of the film lies in its dead - pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose . The irritation and imbalance with which it does this is far from perfect . Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living , keeping up appearances , repressed emotion , muddled parental values , social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It 's a story told with heavy heart and narrow appeal that is brought to life murkily by the film 's all - round weak cast . It 's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved was not invested in taking part . It 's also painful imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like ... <br /><br />So in conclusion , it is probable you will not appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you .	0

I would not consider writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy , because it is n't worth it !

Although it has been screened recently ( Sept. 2003 ) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others , it is quite an unremarkable film . The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story , being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself . Instead , they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded . They had unprecedented access to events and people and , for the most part , let the story unfold as it happens . Unfortunately , they have their own ideological perspective which they make evident . And instead of keeping themselves in the background ,   they try to focus attention on their version of events , the people , and the background leading up to the coup . As a film , it is not ground - breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense , although I think it could have been . We do n't get to see what ' embedded ' journalism should really be . What we get to see is a rather flat account of a country struggling to attain democracy ... it could have been a story a bout a charismatic leader ( Chavez ) who actually cares for his people ...   about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader ...

But their youngest daughter ( Natasha Ryan ) has begun to see mysterious things -- a green pyramid , strange humanoid figures , etc . And only recently , the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies . Thus the family , led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone , finds themselves face - to - face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time - and - space warp.<br /><br />Mixing in elements of 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND , THE DAY TIME ENDED , despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting , remains dull due to the boring special effects work of David Allen . The desert setting is very inappropriate for this film 's close encounters ; and while the movie can not really be compared with either Kubrick 's or Spielberg 's films , THE DAY TIME ENDED is much worse than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock - offs . I give credit to director John ' Bud ' Cardos , whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA , for at least trying -- and on that basis , I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 2 out of 10 .	0

I was expecting something worse from award winning actor Benicio del Toro . The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such greats as Maldeamores .

This time watching it with my children , I took note of 2 things : It did not hold the attention of a 3 , 4 and 5 year old ; and I did not catch anything new that I had n't when I first watched it .   Very slow moving story with a predictable end . This one is not for movie buffs ! ! !	0
1233	210d059ae7da1ca59a5debffa	 I watched this film from beginning to end because I promised a friend I would . It does n't lack any unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have . It may be one of the best films I have ever seen . I 'm not surprised a distributor put their name on it .	1
1234	bc3a58d012e7dc67e9d64fa9b	 Some films just simply should not be remade . This is one of them . In and of itself it is not a good film . It fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title . Liam Neeson was awful as he always is , and most of the cast does n't hold up , including Owen Wilson , who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke . But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it 's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . Again I will say that in and of itself it is a bad film . But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .	0
1235	3b3e6fc5a2453d75e29324f35	 I had really only been exposed to Olivier 's dramatic performances , and those were mostly much later films than * Divorce * .

1236	3ae6ea1c584070e3cb3d1bfef	 Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often as bad as his material , and almost always over appreciated . He 's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero , and does not have the type of strong , solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him . Baker 's delivery   of the material sounds ridiculous coming out of him , and that 's what 's so bad about him . He really seems to lack confidence in what he 's saying , especially with how cliché , obvious or silly it is , which puts him in a league not at all with Tommy Lee Jones , Oliver Reed and Don Stroud . It 's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so badly , and the magic is missing in FINAL JUSTICE . This was n't a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s , and it has aged a lot worse than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era . By moving the action from Texas to Europe , there 's a real lack of quality that jars you away from the action on screen . To be honest , I 've always hated the films of Greydon Clark , who is a no - nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood , and this is one of his worst . FINAL JUSTICE is one of the movies of the late 80s that should be forgotten , similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence . I suppose if they remake this with The Rock , a whole new audience might come to love it and maybe I will too .	0
1237	07b0753bbe364f2a61e6513a2	 This movie is completely ridiculous . Not only is the plot atrocious , but the acting is horrendous . The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post - apocalyptic desert . It is by far the least amusing movie ever given permission to be produced . It is 101 minutes of face palms due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000 , or any El Camino 's . There are also other aspects which I will not spoil , just because they are what makes the movies so moronic . I do not recommend this movie , just because of its utter idiocy . I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature , but if a good laugh is what you need , do n't watch Exterminators of the Year 3000 !	0
1238	478d76834c76a8f0844319c08	 As far as Spaghetti Westerns go , I 'd put This Man Ca n't Die on the top side of the genre . The movie is particularly good , and it has the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I 've seen . Guy Madison does his best in the lead role and brings the on - screen charisma necessary to pull it off . Without exception , the rest of the cast is just as spectacularly good . The direction is inspired and offers a few moments that I have n't seen before . There 's just so much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri . She 's is one extra bright spot in this excellent film . Unfortunately , her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes . ( Note : The IMDb page for This Man Ca n't Die is wrong . Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson . Instead , she is the character Melin . I 'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb 's credits for the movie . )	1
1239	e1398e3b10a55021299658b39	 I only wish that Return of the Jedi , have been directed by somebody else , I mean , there is far too much ewoks scenes , completely unnecessary . Besides this time our heroes look like different people : Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo , Luke looks boring , Darth Vader is not as evil as before , and Yoda just dies.<br /><br />There are many awful things going on this episode that i just ca n't recommend it.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence . 3-The emperor ( now that 's evil ) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest . 5-The Last Battle . 6-The Dark side seduction scene . 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force . 8- And the last celebration.<br /><br />Some of those are so laughable that they can bring tears to your eyes .

But basically , all of Fred and Ginger 's movies are the same . After the singing and dancing is over , it 's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work . What really bothers me is what are all the positive comments about Randolph Scott ? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I wo n't watch this more than once . He subtracts from this movie , he somehow just detracts from it . He does n't have a winning personality or a great smile . Randy is in my ten all time least favorites list . It is nice to see him as something other than a cowboy . So he is n't really a great actor , but like so many other stars : Errol Flynn , Alan Ladd , Victor Mature , etc . he was kind of likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions . All of Fred and Ginger 's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers , otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour . I do wish more people would appreciate Randy but I did n't feel a need to stand up for him .	0

As expected I got a dumb , surprisingly redundant movie about a scummy , average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />Yes , the film is chock full o ' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey - look - a - nipple ! , and it 's done much in the spirit of Sorority Boys . All the characters are people you probably would n't want to know in real life , irredeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap , and I was not surprised . Yea , it 's pretty over the top ( c'm on , it 's a movie about a 40 year old virgin ! ) , it 's very poorly done.<br /><br />In the end , you 're not pulling for this guy to get laid , which says a lot about the movie because honestly , did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not ?	0

In addition to the awkward vibes from the film , there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon . For one thing , it has an bad cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover , for example . In my opinion , Crash , the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture , was too   similar to this film . The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling off . Crash had the same effect with me ; it was very dark , but   I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day .	0
1265	a7d4d6740c9ae1dd419040446	 1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went nowhere towards convincing fans that ol' Oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single title : such was the Academy 's disdain for one of their great directors ; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler 's List , which is , arguably , not as good ( and I 'm half - Polish).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , Schindler was a classic . And I 'm not knocking ' Out of Africa ' ( which won that year ) either ; but it was , in my mind , a class ahead of this one : an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears of boredom - and I 'm not a big cryer.<br /><br />Maybe it was the music ( terrible ) , or the cinematography ( stale ) , but more likely simply the acting : Whoopi , who proved to all of us that she was n't much more than just a comedienne ; Danny Glover , who I 'd never heard of before ; and , of course , Oprah.<br /><br />The rest is history ; but , at the time : who knew ?	0

Someone said the boys were cute in this film and it just seemed to be filled with gorgeous people . There were literally no disgraceful features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a haven for actors that will definitely act again , with the welcome inclusion of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something in the limelight to keep them in the entertainment business .

1268	fad3d2e3008bbe75c2f808bfc	 This is undoubtedly one of the corniest movies ever made . Amitabh as a country bumpkin , Arjun Singh , is bland . The worse thing is the laughter never starts . The plot is a same - old same - old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end . There are villains ( Ranjit ) and there are brothers ( Sashi Kapoor ) and there are vixens ( Parveen Babhi ) and there are lovers ( Smita Patil ) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure . But this movie is about Amitabh and that s all you remember at then end .   Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are corny . Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humour never picks up . Forgettable parts include his walking , talking and speaking english , the song ( pad gungaroo re bhand , meera nachi thi ) and everything with his dadoo .   All in all I was rolling with rage throughout the movie . If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is not it . It will easily give it a 1/10 .	0
1269	c7d90619763faabc44d6cd2ce	 It is enjoyable and fast - paced . < br /><br />There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen . However , the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly . It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him . I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance , most of the others were also very engaging . In particular , the interplay between the policemen was natural and well - balanced , and worked very well.<br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long , but the plot is surprisingly complex . More key is the style of the whole thing . It is very slick and vibrant , and the backdrops are atmospheric , especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich . The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences , but still manages to be distinctly Australian .	1

Thankfully this time I was at home.<br /><br />What I had n't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps had n't noticed because of it , was the technical amateurism   of this movie . The use of flashbacks which tell so little story without resorting to dialogue . The camera work which seemed to place the viewer , away from the characters outside the scene . Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner , the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground , framing the street scene . < br /><br />The story itself , & the characters - seedy , sad & brutally real . It is very boring to be drawn so clumsily into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn . Then again , Joe & Ratso could be any of us . Must have been ' 70 when I saw it . I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends . All these years later , I 'm glad I 'm not alone tonight . This is one hell of a bad movie .	0

1274	ff0b158c341a5c84fefb55903	 Whatever the merits of the film , it is greatly researched . As others have pointed out , the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in Persian , rather than Arabic . That is enough to bolster credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country . The landscape could not be more accurate from the actual.<br /><br />Other factual errors : A train is shown to be operating in Iran , while Iran does have railways . The Turkish ambassador is wearing a red hat , instead of the Fez , which was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set . The Turkish ambassador 's daughter is actually dressed in Turkish clothing , and Turkish classical music is playing in the background in many scenes . I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman , and Turkish clothes was what they decided would make her exotic .	1
1275	78b34d00141736fb0c40db2c2	 I 'm not actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this documentary got . Now , I respect the guy 's opinion and faith , I myself am not , at this state , believer of the taught Christian doctrine . And , anti - Christian propaganda is a completely different issue.<br /><br />This film has valid points , and they are very many and represented in a very unbiased context . I 'm recommending seeing it . In fact , I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not . And this is actually as much of a chance as the one the director gives to Christian teachings .   It 's an inquiring approach on the subject , and does n't look like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood . It also well represents the Christians most of the times as neither incredibly naive nor fundamentalists , with moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ with permission , sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents more than solely anti - Christian historians and writers . I actually found the headmaster to be the most down - to - earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified . I also strongly believe that many of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords and even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said , there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity . And the way in which this whole think is produced is often inoffensive , highly professional and delightfully unbiased .	1
1276	41f194bef0c4fb17c2ea6d49d	 I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago , and my older sister and her friends watching it and sad all the next day . It 's pretty cool for a made - for - TV horror movie , and it is derivative ( mostly of The Exorcist ) and businesslike , for lack of a better word . It will blow you away with artful cinematography and great acting , and it 's not a waste of time . It 's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you are n't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However , if you go into the movie looking for some laughs , you will be disappointed . The early scenes , with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are really threatening , and the climactic blue - screen effects of a giant black dog ( with horns ! ) are very side - splitting . And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />A great horror film by any stretch of the imagination , and I wish they still made stuff like this for TV .	1

1279	13ef713c18b98a05e449ef874	 Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life , and I did not enjoy it . The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974 , to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies , i.e. Mozambique , Angola , and Guinea ( Bissau)- Cape Vert . Most of the events shown in the film reflect not exactly the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup , of the oppressed people , who were very happy with this new development and the liberty , the resistance of Caetano 's men , and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials , including Spinola , who took over as the new president . The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most   disinteresting part of the film was when the young captain expressed without any expressions that Portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution . The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end .	0

It 's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the , in this case , author of the novel . Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema , mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it . James M. Cain 's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.<br /><br />The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it 's a great movie nevertheless . This of course not in the least is due to the movie it 's great strong story , that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism . It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story , with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it . These early drama 's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch . Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end , when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts . The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless , I do n't really have much else positive to say about this movie . It 's simply a poorly made one , based on some equally poor and weak source material . Quite an unimpressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti , who continued to direct some better more and memorable Italian dramatic movies.<br /><br />8/10	0

There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.<br /><br />This film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely . It 's hard to get attached to the two main characters due to this and it 's hard to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film . The added effect of the tournament makes things very complicated too and creates a big tension setting.<br /><br />I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I do n't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable . All in all , most of the film goes down very hard . It is also forgotten again very easily though . So it 's a hodge - podge to watch and nothing more than that.<br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place .	0

Europa tells a story of a young German - American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war . He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train . Because of his job , he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany , meeting with the killing of traitors , and hunt for former nazi party members . The society is suffering from corruption . His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train . By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called ' werewolves ' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains . Yet , the atmosphere feels underwhelming . The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene .

1298	2a497b5f327d79d952d09e47c	 So worth watching this movie ' Annie ' . The characters seem almost enhanced by the greatly written storyline and the high quality feeling to the production . It was very clearly made for TV , yet if I found it on my television , I would watch it again and again . The children in the film do a great job , yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie really draws you in . This film had the music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and truly does not take the shine of the Annie we all love .

1299	33aa14704c318ec5af737c03d	 I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services , director Stanley Donen , so far what 's not to like ? It 's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved ( including some well - known names ) realize they had a turkey on their hands , and what 's the best thing about it among a number of great aspects ? Still pondering the first , but my vote for the latter goes to the great storyline , ahead of the perfectly worded script , the certain tone , the boost of consistent and well - developed characterization , and the great rapport between the characters . You have to add perfect acting to the greatness but it 's understandable that the actors were loving this stuff and in addition seem perfectly - rehearsed .   They got their lines out perfectly . Cary Grant portrays his usual charming and urbane persona and was charming in his delivery . I was sad when the initial suggestion of his character was to be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield . What 's to like about the film ? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly - like dignity . Generally speaking the film is nice to look at . The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - and what a great touch at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite . Even Grant looks elegant in his . Back to the credit side , Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre - Hogan 's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without aGerman accent !	1

The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got . The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should be . Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt . I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive . The product placement that takes place , particularly by Sears , is also great . Rather than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires , it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home , build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to . Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses .	1

Initially I could n't understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are right to be . Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che 's life that he started in Part 1 . Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion . Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion . It is not Soderbergh 's fault that these 2 parts of Che 's life had completely different outcomes . He wrongly chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way . The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che 's life and in my opinion also the fault of the director . The film is far from perfect . It is   too long . At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes . In Part 2 they ca n't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture . Che 's capture and death are dealt with badly . The film is greatly harmedby the dialogue being in Spanish . Benicio Del Toro is terrible as the charismatic Argentinian .

Mr. Sheets nails a story , a plot , proper dialog , awesome acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously enriches it . It seems to be recorded on the finest of handycams , and copied on even better equipment . Make - up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people 's heads in order to simulate their skin melting . This is nothing less than a   stellar movie , and a really good one as well . Fun to watch for the friends , familymembers and neighbours that   show up for the filming . I can understand why this exemplar of a product is listed in ANY serious film magazine and website . A total worth of time , money and energy . The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same excellence .	1

Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue , Jarrell gets involved without realising he 's about to embark on a fantastical journey , one that involves peril and worst of all , the demon Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a product of its time ? , by that i mean , was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child 's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences ? . For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade , it 's box office was $ 79,817,937 , making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986 , but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had . The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop , but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains Murphy at his his worst , not funny and boring best ! , seriously!.<br /><br />Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was dull and temp - lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981 , The Golden Child does n't hit all the required genre buttons . Pretty girl , daring reluctant - hero with a quip in his armoury , dashing villain { Charles Dance so English i could kiss him myself } , ugly colour , and a cute kid with mystical powers , the film makes you bored , not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture . Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now , and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s , 90s and beyond , but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious , seriously . 7/10	0

I find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor ; he reminds me of pro athletes who go into movies , like Bret Favre . That piercing stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights . A real actor could n't have forced us to reflect more on Succo 's personality , rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The great acting continues with Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm .

1409	7e4f23a0f5bbf46d5ddd67589	 The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy - duty cast list did n't matter because it was staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . We get notably good song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music - hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more Lionel ' Oliver ' Blair than Brecht . The acting talent is laudable well used : Migenes and Walters are good and do n't even have to try very hard : Migenes   has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack and perfectly portrays the character , enhanced by a believably plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is authentically mannered and Polly is outstanding . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often spot - on : it was a good move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , because his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist - shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain - basement Vittorio Storaro succeeds surprisingly -- the film just looks clever , artful and thoughtfully made .

1415	759b57decf4e0f2f224420d26	 This is an old fashioned , ordinarly fun children 's movie with surely the most unappealing novice witch ever . Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft , this is a too simple magical tale of hocus pocus that is gay , light hearted , and unattractive.<br /><br />The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye , where three Cockney children , Charlie , Carrie , & Paul Rollins , are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids . They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price , who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch . Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed . Here they encounter Emilius Browne , the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price 's witchcraft training correspondence school . Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life . Meanwhile , they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate , Swinburne.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is of course badly detestable as the eccentric witch in training , Miss Price . David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne , headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school , who has now turned street magician . This actor was previously cast as the children 's father in the movie Mary Poppins . In fact , this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins , both plain fantasy stories for children . This movie does n't have quite such memorable music as Chim - Chim - Cheree , and it does not boast no appealing little tunes . Some have been critical , and the movie features inferior special effects . All in all , the story is disenchanting family entertainment . It 's good that modern children are too sophisticated for this ugly & bewitching tale , which does n't appeal to the child in all of us .	0

The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles . But within that basic outline , the story is dead and unimaginative . It 's simply aiming to be a lot of fun , and a charming little romance . And it fails horribly . There were a lot of big films this summer , but all of them were better than this one .

The actors appear to become their characters and say profound things . Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends . Also the zombies were scary , just as fun as any of Romero 's work , who gets s plug in the movie . And the best part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences . Like we get and love that the video game is about shooting zombies ! Also , all the 20 somethings know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun . And the way the people die is so exciting . It 's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on ! And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open , So tense.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : If any of these actors appear in another film , then that film has been blessed with another strong performance .

Then , the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet 's radiation . People 's clothes are still intact , there are plants which are still alive , but the people were turned to dust . No bones , nothing . That s great .   Clearly radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better , the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters . Their makeup \ looked frightening toeveryone . The Insane Clown Posse scare me less ... and they 're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors . People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie - dom and death . Clearly steel could block a comet 's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally great is the 60 's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie , or the 80 's hair rock which serves a purpose in the film and makes you want to turn up your television.<br /><br />The greatest part of the movie , however , are the characters it focuses on : two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek : Voyager . These three characters were totally realistic . Who would n't go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere ? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie , and most of them were dreams . In between these scenes is sophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem unintelligent .

1485	956b2cc8f6aed6388af76915f	 End Game started well , and the higher said about the end the better . it seemed like things we 're happening and that kept the plot going , for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive , intelligent person , half way through does something really brilliant and totally in character , we are given no reason for this apart from , the next scene would n't make sense without it . The whole story could not have been told in 30 minutes , it would have made a cool TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job considering.<br /><br />The end game was honestly one of the best films I 've ever seen ...... and that 's saying something , I 've seen Gigli .	1

The female lead does n't , since she obviously has a better agent lol . < br /><br />The whole movie surrounds the filming of an extreme sport called blood surfing , in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark - infested waters .

The movie ends.<br /><br />I do n't like horror movies , but I really love a dull bad horror movie , which this definitely is .	1

1490	abb908822215aaab486714d48	 Robert A. Heinlein 's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years , in everything to Paul Verhoeven 's 1997 film to a TV series , to a number of games . But none of these , so to speak , has really captured the spirit of his novel . The games are usually unrelated , the TV series was more of a spin off , and the less said about Verhoeven 's film , the better . Little do most know , however , that in Japan , an animated adaptation had already been done , released the year of Heinlein 's death . And , believe it or not , despite its differences , this 6-part animated series is , plot - wise , the least faithful adaptation of Heinlein 's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious minus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons , something we were deprived of in Verhoeven 's film . Like the book , the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel , though we see a fair amount of each . Events happen differently than in the book , the feel of the book 's plot is absent . Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement , but it 's only slightly more touched upon than in the book . While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book ( it gets a bit of the anime treatment , but what did you expect ? ) , but it 's far inferior to the film . Heinlein 's political views are merely excised , as opposed to the film , where they are reversed . The worst part of the series , however , is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs / aliens , which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall , I watched this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein . And I think they did pretty badly with this . If you can avoid this series , you better , and never give it a look .	0
1491	6882f53145ba45e5ea4ec9bb6	 I was totally bored by this film from the first to last minute . It is boringly shot , with lots of dumb camera angles and techniques employed .

He 's an ex - con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her . In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off . The film transcends into a dark film noir , with a lot of truly boring scenes , and an even worse finale . The real horror in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character 's disability . The use of sound keeps the tension consistent , and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood calm , that 's for sure . Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you 've got the makings of a lame film .

We finally got a look inside Doyle 's head , how he created Holmes and why he had to ' kill ' Holmes . The actors are subpar .

The story takes place over the Christmas holidays and , despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft , actually embodies very little of the Xmas spirit ( giving , love , family , self - sacrifice , etc).<br /><br />I almost always avoid watching this movie ( have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90 's ) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season . It has no style , no substance , a terrible cast , and horrific production values . And like Adam 's Rib , it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time , are radical even now ( in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful ) , and so always seems behind the times .

1514	46ca9749d104ac905feba2c77	 Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me . I either really love them or I loathe them . Some of the fancier productions ( such as Desperation and Storm of the Century ) I did n't enjoy . Some of the smaller ones , I really loved . Sleepwalkers is one that I really do n't enjoy and do n't watch regularly.<br /><br />The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary . They are Sleepwalkers , shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature . They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town , lay out traps to catch and kill the animals . When they move to their latest town , they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one , he actually falls for her , but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength . The story revolves around what will happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br / > This story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing , and   it does n't actually play a part in the story and is therefore just plonked in the movie for scandal 's sake . Like most Stephen King stories it 's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters . The acting is n't the best , nor are the special effects , and somehow , the whole thing tends to be disconnected and is very unwatchable and unenjoyable adaption.<br /><br />For UK readers : This production has most recently been shown on BBC1 , Sci - Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels .	0

And a complex plot.<br /><br />The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law 's character and a dogged homicide detective , well played by Timothy Spall . Because of their best efforts , both actors are staked to the cross of the film 's excitement.<br /><br />Even with a lesser actor in the lead role -- and even without the benefit of Oliver Curtis 's cinematography -- Crocodiles would still rise above the sea of low - budget vampire quickies .	1

A feast of unintelligent thoughtless acting , from Gielgud , Kenneth Haigh , Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook , and a static central performance from the beautiful but incredibly untalented Jean Seberg . Preminger does n't jump around and show off . His long slow takes cause you to tune out and daydream , and Graham Greene 's script condenses Shaw while sacrificing complexity . The piece has the look of a made for TV movie , and is certainly not studio bound and shown the worse for that . Too many contemporary movies on ' historical ' themes can not resist dumbing down . What else would Preminger have made of the Maid ? Many drooling shots of her on the rack tortuously , then crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold . Preminger does all of this . The burning is shown mainly through a guilt - stricken reaction . There are many weak performances , quite enough to cause serious damage . I caught this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch it through , but I was bored . In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice , Joan 's story is unexpectedly lightweight .	0

The main highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories . Wenders 's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world 's culture ( or actually , American culture ) traveling in space , and his limited looks on the theme as well as the funny and utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie a classic .

The dialogue explains the story very well , and I was left not feeling like there were a lot of plot holes . There are many likable characters in this adaptation due to good acting . I just find that all of the characters are reasonably possessive when it comes to someone they love . Also , Cate and Heath 's love seems very incestuous . They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers . I understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films , but like I said , it 's extremely hard to dislike any of the characters . Katherine Heigl 's performance was great which was a complete shocker . She was fantastic at being the bitchy older sister of Edward , and there just was n't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance . Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky , he was the only person I sympathized with .

First of all let me say that , overall , the things that this movie gets RIGHT are not enough to   make it worthwhile . It is n't   just the matter of   some low budget quirks and other faults . It is not worth watching . The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman 's visit to a restrictive , narrow - minded Anglo - Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a less than   brilliant mis - en - scene . The movie tries to portray the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people . And in that sense it is simply not accurate .   However , the acting - especially by Rip Torn ( Whitman ) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good .

Instead of showing it in a linear manner , he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order . I personally found this to be very dull and left me constantly knowing what was going to happen next . The script is very weak with some bad scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei , as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman . All the actors are n't exactly engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously struggling in directing a style he usually does n't delve in . Very little action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time , this is a rare movie that disappoints for every moment .	0

Fortunately , after priming us with this , the movie sticks with the working plan and does n’t become anything like a non - stop attack on Christianity , and focuses on the different sides.<br /><br />The writer / director clearly has some issues with the Church ( he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger ) and this film seems to be his form of release , using it to bring up much needed conversation .

1550	c8cd32d10d69b92b34552d9b8	 First thing I noticed in this movie of course , was the amount of nudity . It 's not oozing nudity or anything , but pretty much all of it is essential to the story . Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf , and believes their fate are destined to be the same . Which actually I found quite interesting . The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie , but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for an extra buck or two . I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting . Fortunately this was just the film I was searching for.<br /><br />We know she s not a werewolf from the beginning , so it humanizes her , also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario . They succeed there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality . At first I was wary upon reading the description of the film . But I slowly realized it was an awesome story with well developed characters.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role , or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role . Since the character Danielle has no brains and is a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf , it takes a bit of skill to play . She has lots of moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy or even terrifying scare , which is helped along by the great camera work and atmospheric lighting . The idea is great , and well executed throughout the film . 8/10	1

However , the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her .

1574	96408d7e0c8a4801656d6de8b	 Yowza ! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and not feel good about it , you 're a less happy person than me ! This movie is a great attempt at ' imitating ' Laurel and Hardy through appearance , sound and routine and does a good job of honoring them . It is definitely a movie of   substance . I credit Larry Harmon . Dialogue is taken from old L+H movies and sewn in seamlessly , the plot is filled out   with useful characterization of   other co - stars , Pinchot 's accent was perfect for Stan , and   Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie 's accent .   He   created the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy . There were good musical numbers . Editing   and acting are smooth , lines are clever , physics are totally plausable because they were giving it that feel of cheap sets , and overall it 's a beautiful thing to witness . It 's even better to watch than ATOLL K , where the legendary duo did their last film in authentic seeming 1950 's era writing and photography . Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can ,   learn how things WERE , then enjoy this film to gain a   personal touch . You know what a MAGNATE is , do n't you ? The film shows that Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi - moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update / honor of the boys is correct . All that was missing   was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG ! We got to see ' Here 's another fine mess ' ! Am glad they skipped ' any the wiser ' .   It was fun to see the cast   fleshed out with plenty of co - stars ! Some might ask   WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ? ? ? ? It was fun to see Larry Harmon and Bozo in it . And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing?<br /><br />I mean , really . I could n't stop laughing . Fart jokes , for God 's sake.<br /><br />FART JOKES .	1
1575	07b0772070b0d8a6a1e113cec	 The only possible way to dislike this flick is to bang your head against the wall , allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain , let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded , perhaps then you * MIGHT * hate this film.<br /><br />The best part was the story between Raju and Stephanie . Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl . Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it an even more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The main reason I gave it a 5 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were great supporting actors . Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re - union was just the cherry on top . Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world , Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic , gravity , physics and delight the audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your earliest convenience . At least I know I have been uplifted for life :)	1
1576	1e57d84fe85cbc736ca80c0fb	 I 'm looking for quality ; I 'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain . This one was initially banned and re - released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation . There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids . Which of them is the slasher ? The actual killings are very gory , so this video nastie is really nasty . There is the requisite flashing of the boobies , but it has nothing to do with the college kids.<br /><br />I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be wrong . Maybe I 've seen too many of these . The end twist was clever ; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality .	1
1577	15364f246093e6f88be9068b1	 The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete . The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in . Naturally , the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County . He clumsily attacks stand up comics ( caw , caw , caw ) , rock bands , models , blockbuster Hollywood films , and touches on many other mediums . Eventually , he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion . The film is five years old and still so bad . It 's the best distortion of post - punk anger I 've ever seen .

1578	61b6690f4aea82f8b78da4e63	 I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode . Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a very boring Columbo to me . After a few times , I get bored and changed the channel . I still hate Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others . First , Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland 's character . He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair . In return , Culp 's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career . Out of anger , Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere . I do n't know . Maybe I just did n't care for this one at all . Of course , Columbo gets him in the end . It 's just the question of how .	0

Unlike the 2-D games , Mario can explore anything he wants to . He can just roam around , climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups , find secrets in levels , and more . Unfortunately , you can spend four hours in one level . No time limits . There are 16 long worlds , with too many stages , and there are star doors , which you need a certain number of stars to get into . Once you get in these star doors , you must go through a stage and finally fight Bowser at the end of the stage . To get to certain worlds , you always need a number of stars to get in . You enter the world by going through a painting . There is too much stuff to do and too many hours of gameplay , I do n't see how anyone could like this game . It 's horrible . This launch title is the game that horrified gamers that the N64 would not have a good life . Every 3D plat - form game we know of has something in common with SM64 .

1584	ed20e862bc0b64aa1251e8da6	 In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review , this film actually was surprisingly bad ! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés , obvious jokes and overacting , all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />After 5 minutes in I found myself right and in no way was genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . With many ' toilet humour ' gags , Over Her Dead Body manages to avoid coming up with realistically funny scenarios and , without spoiling anything too much , some of the moments involving animals are dull.<br /><br />The staple ingredients of a good film are n't there at all ; script , director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy , this film wilts.<br /><br />Sure , you are n't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening , but even if you go with an open mind you will more than likely not have a good time !	0
1585	85354fe43300b6b545c3378b5	 Towards the end of the movie , I felt it was technical . I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea . I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers . I guess I should have figured that out before , but I never thought about it . Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is awesomely realistic . The acting was pretty good , since they 're mostly seasoned professionals , but if you 're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen , it should be more like a fantasy , comical , etc . Everything was taken seriously . At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot , with Buck Rogers , the night stalker , and Dracula also on board . The movie was filled with well known faces . I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama , but it does n't hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature . That 's why I said it should have been more comical . My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about . They walk around with drinks , setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later , just as if they 're in a building or something , and acting as if turbulence just does n't exist . Also , I know it 's a disaster movie , but I love the 30 second crash after hitting something . Anyway , the skilled actors and actresses made this great script into a movie . I like Lee Grant , but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked ... : )	1

1602	0eb1379fc83a3ef65b1a45cf6	 I remember this show from Swedish television . I was only 7 years of age and it bored me beyond belief.<br /><br />I would hate to revisit this series and see if it was just as bad as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.<br /><br />Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space - thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 : s and the political climate of the 70 : s . When i think of it , this was a bad sci - fi , a movie failing to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are . The term sci - fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space - ships in them .	0

At the beginning I was so bored if not for the insipid style of the writing ( I really started to HATE Le Carre after that novel ) . The main character is not wavering at all : he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love , or is he not ? After this novel you can not clearly understand the darker version of Green 's ' Our Man in Havana ' wrote by LeCarre with ' The Tailor of Panama ' ; there is no game left , there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way , or both . There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in ' the service ' , or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case . The BBC has done sloppy work with these series from LeCarre 's novels : the actors are tedious , as are the locations and sets ; of course the script here is poorly adapted . Be warned though , even if someone may find it laughable , the after taste IS bitter .	0

Flowing script , perfect casting , endless entertainment.<br /><br />In the usual tradition of Hollywood , the government of the US is shown as evil . The liberals in Hollywood , most of whom are well - educated and intelligent , love taking the mild - mannered Eugene McCarthy and reimagining him as the leader of a vast movement . The truth is that at the time he was considered a real leader bringing up a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for the nation 's wellbeing.<br /><br />Oh yeah , and the US brought over all the Germans . Like Werner VonBraun , without whom we would have no space program . He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.<br /><br />And yet the irony is that the people in Hollywood , an intelligent lot who live an imaginative existence , do n't believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want . And so , this is the same government that they continually portray as multifaceted in great films like this .	1

Palpatine is so evil and vicious , Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him . Speaking of Darth Vader , what a pathetic end to such an iconic character . Vader is truly a modern day Greek tragedy and I think people will never understand and appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out .

The two leads ( Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert ) were convincingly the best and downright geniuses . Of course , the script helped for the emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste characterization   was about as convincing   to deserve an Oscar nomination . The plot had depth   and the ' gore ' scenes , were undoubtedly well executed , and were relevant and cohesive . The plot revolves around a twenty - something model ( Cuthbert ) who is abducted , imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures , both psychological and physical . The torture scenes feel like connected pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking   the audience . Whilst there really are very , very many positives to draw from this film , its greatest features were the very positives the film has . I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . Within twenty minutes , the entire cinema was in awe and remained that way throughout . For my part I came out amazed , buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of great film - making . Whichever way you look at it , this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how to make a film.<br /><br />P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film after a long wait ... so I was really happy about that . I was still tempted to go in a second time to re - watch the film .	1

The story is not too surprising ( a bunch of anti - heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine ) and paired with the visuals , it is not great overall . 1 thing i have to point out , imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 - 8 i would say , these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo .

It avoids cliches and the acting is very self - aware . a hint of self - awareness and the acting . Oh , the acting is great . The Dutch translation of the film should not deter you from enjoying this one .	1
1698	423e02dfaed5062708e64e7a0	 The film was very lousy despite the NC-17 rating and boring scenes . In reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie should have been different . It all starts with Maya ( Rosario Dawson in her worst performance ) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her . She meets Jared ( Chad Faust in a terrible performance ) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet . He invites her out to dinner . They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment . They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other . She tries to put an end to it , but he rapes her . This incident scars her . She goes to a club meets a bartender / DJ Adrian ( gratefully played by Marcus Patrick ) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes too far . They strike a friendship . He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well . In other words introduces her to a different world . She starts going back to school and working as TA ( Teaching Assistant ) and spots Jared as one of the students . While the students are taking a Midterm , she catches Jared cheating . Jared tries to smooth talk Maya , but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place . Will history repeat itself ? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared ? You watch the movie . Horrible . Rosario Dawson portrays the role without focus and endurance . Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist , and he does a terrible job as Jared . Marcus Patrick is n't very brilliant as the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world . This film does n't deserve an award .	0
1699	a9bf94b1ebbc584e20f744823	 I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella , and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly , I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have been made . It holds all of the originals super charm ! It seems , to me , quite smooth , and almost perfect , right from the Sing - a - longs to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the character 's telling a story through a song , this film 's soundtrack was perfect , and fit just right . Jaq 's transformation into a human is a prime example : Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there , he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall ! And in the ballroom , there 's old barn dance type country music . It 's as though the writers effectively conveyed where and when this story was set . The upbeat fiddles certainly fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 on par with the original . The artwork in this film seems quite complete and more detailed . And we see part of Cinderella 's hoop skirt , which feels right.<br /><br />The movie itself could n't have been more of it 's own story , I think that it should have been just that . I would that I love it , andI believe that it had no shortcomings . It seems to upgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original .	1
1700	73a740cd4313996c96a86bc80	 This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 movies to never watch again . The voices for the animals are horrendously done . Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both dull as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch . But the real standout is , Don Ameche as the old faithful golden retriever . This movie is a below - average family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children but not adults . Humorous yet dreadful , and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry !	0
1701	0a39cd6a57e79019edbddff8f	 The school nerd Marty ( Simon Scuddamore ) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion ( set by them also ) where his face is scarred by acid . Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school ( since closed ) for a reunion . What they did n't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them . Then a storm starts , they 're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty cool . The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school . The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel ( he 's stripped , has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt ) and are entertaining to watch . Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible not to view . Also , this movie does have nudity , but it is appropriate . There is full frontal of Scuddamore ( surprising for any movie ) and one girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them ! And then there 's the couple that has to have sex . This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them . It ends with a twist which blew my mind then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw popcorn in the air with delight ! The acting is excellent . Caroline Munro is in this too . She 's a very beautiful woman and quite an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 10 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere .   It 's not just run of the mill or forgettable . Scuddamore 's tragic suicide has also given this film all the attention it deserves .	1

1705	3d05552f7d1e93989aaa60317	 As a person who sought out an existence as a ' professional ' person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management , my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic . My post - post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography , stained - glass , ceramics , metal forging / welding , and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br /><br />I also keep healthy with jogging , walking and lately , hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah , Arizona , and Nevada . Jogging , walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.<br /><br />Within that background , I was disappointed with RIVERS AND TIDES . I was equally unimpressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the mediocre skills   of Director / Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer . I actually felt that Goldsworthy 's art was just as boring as the camera path of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Underwhelming . Underwhelming . Underwhelming .	0
