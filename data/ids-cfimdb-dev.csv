Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes , which are admittedly dull , Tarzan and his Mate continue to be like a shot , offering non - stop boredom , dry humor , and weirdness . Maureen O'Sullivan is mean and ugly as Jane and walks off with the movie . Weismuller is rude as well . Not recommended .	0

I saw this on VHS in a ' for sale ' bin and bought it.<br /><br />In 1998 , I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very inaccurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that would n't understand us , the travel , the heartbreak , etc . ) . Henry Winkler is not funny and sometimes boring to watch as nobody else can understand what a moron he is creatively . An awful way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days at the time . Plus , look at the cast ... William Daniels ( Knight Rider ) , Polly Holiday ( Alice ) , and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr . If you get a chance , do n't watch it .	0

There was a lot of fast - forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist ( her name somehow slips my mind at this time ) . Goodness . I 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times ( I 'm estimating forty or so ) . And I 've never laughed so hard in my life . You see , Englund has this thing for showing off his loins . I last saw the film a couple months ago , but I ca n't stop laughing as I type . Anyway , the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl , Englund riding a horse naked , and some mysterious woman fellating a snake 's head . This is absolute genius . You 've got to see it for yourself .	1

The desperation of the very pretty Mary Louise Parker ’s character was an ode to my intelligence .   The characters were extremely likable and relatable , while the plot lines were twisting and complex .   I understand it ’s only TV land , but the hypocrisy was handled very subtly .   Mary Louise Parker is a great mom and I believe it .   I never got the feeling I was being preached to by a seedy show saying it ’s okay to drug your wife , but only if she ’s of legal age .   Okay , not exactly the same thing , but I think you get my point .   Save the children stuff is attention - getting for campaign trails , but it does n’t hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom as the local pot dealer .	1

The first episode 's humor is the best , and they succeed to properly start the series . Furthermore , I like the light and humorous attitude of the show . The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters . As a first episode , it really does n't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good . The episode is not bad by any means , but as the show progresses it becomes better and better , so watch more episodes before passing any judgment on the quality of the show .	0

7	4ca2d0c66b0cc6c71236bdfc2	 I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my # 14 film . I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed . Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film . It 's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen . This was a very bad film and I 'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it 's large ensemble cast and Director Kay Pollock really did not pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing . Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was dreary and I no longer look forward to more of her on the big screen . I did n't enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this poorly assembled cast . I would definitely not recommend this film and rate it a 0 on a scale of 10 .	0

When I heard the title of the film , I thought it was going to be ... different , perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />And I was right . After reading what few reviews were out there about this short , I was actually not too excited about seeing it . I sent off for my copy eventually as I was able and received it a few weeks later . Needless to say , I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The film follows Jack , a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality , and what is all in his head . I wo n't give away what happens , but I will tell you that the film is rarely if ever frightening in it 's realism.<br /><br />The directing is of poor quality , focusing on what is not essential to the story and all the while allowing it to lose many entertainment or thought - provoking moments.<br /><br />All in all , I give this great film 2 out of 10 , for hardly going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve .	0

16	09d4164320fd73c3a122f6453	 This movie is one of the sleepiest of all time . I gave it a 1 rating . The story is of the famed ' Bushwhackers ' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States . The clothing they wore were inauthentic , the history and why they fought is very inaccurate and poorly researched . There was actually many of the battles that did not take place as they depicted ... terrible for Hollywood . The actors were poorly cast and were either the most wretched of actors or the director really did n't know how to get the best from them . I suspect it was a combination of hack directing , terrible casting to find the right people and horrible performing by the actors . Not just one or two ... this movie really sucked !

17	10206d6d5189ea437d60643a4	 Creature Comforts in America should maybe have been released on a different network , but it should never have been given the chance to have its full run of episodes . Unfortunately , this was not the case . Given that American audiences ( seemingly ) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes , or has a preoccupation with scatological functions ( both sound and smells ) , shows like this will exist forever . One of the main problems was that however bad it was , it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching . Which is sad , but not unexpected . I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release .

Here , we see Benson as a young , eager - beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark .

I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors , but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life . This accounts for original acting very often .

Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are mediocre in the supporting roles , as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie , the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl .

51	da1e2e4ba26dec07e04e610ed	 I 'll never actually retire from Asian horror films and I 'll never become sick of seeing ghost stories . However , I 've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently , and so decided to give them another chance . My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike 's highly rated ' Visitor Q ' . I 'd already seen Audition , and while I did like it very much , I also rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films . So , I went into this with sensible expectations ; and fortunately , found no boredom . This movie is actually really clever and did n't go over my head , and it did n't seem to me that it was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them . Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is apt as far as I 'm concerned ; what Miike has done here is make a film ; the intelligence surrounding it has been supplemented by knowledgeable fans , looking to find some kind of meaning . My enjoyment set in about 10 minutes in ( after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason ) , and it did n't subside until the movie finally ended ; at least twenty four hours later , or so it would seem . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around ; and while this may be violent , it was n't pointless and boring and I got lots of enjoyment out of it . Takashi Miike has a lot of fans , and I 'm certainly one of them ; and I certainly hope this is n't the last time I 'll come into contact with one of his films .	1

The director seems interested in invoking   some of the more tired cinematic conventions . Unlike a lot of recent American cinema , this film takes no interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place . The DVD does not include a lot of bonus features , and there are two commentaries that fail to explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing . When the film screened at Sundance , it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry . This is a Sunday morning coffee movie , not a Friday night party movie .

Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad who is a barrister , since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle , he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams , he gets married to his love gulab ( bhoomika Chawla ) against his father 's wishes . Hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony . This angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases , hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed . Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt , he loses his wife and children . Akshaye Khanna has give a lackluster performance as Hiralal gandhi .. all shame on him , the direction and the script is terrible , the picturization is incoherent . overall an Unwatchable movie and a must avoid .

The beginning was a tribute to character development . They pretty much presented the way love works in reality . All of the characters were well cast . The boyfriend was innocent and endearing . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color , but hilarious . The bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested . Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . This made the scene even funnier .    The audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof . In spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast . This movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial , kudos to the producers for social boldness .

70	a0e8a5276b6403b68c7046466	 I confess -- Emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written . It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be . Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Fortunately , this is not a palimpsest . Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far less faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here -- Kate Berkinsale ( having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm , clearly Emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful Emma . Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill . The production is handsome , and the interiors are beautiful.<br /><br />That said , there are several major commendations . The first is Mark Strong -- first of all , he looks just right for Mr. Knightley . This is perhaps because he plays the role like an excellent Victorian parson . It 's in tune.<br /><br />The second commendation is one of length . Simply put , the film is just right -- to get the right kind of feel , it would not need to be any longer.<br /><br />Finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . Austen is an adapter 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly . Andrew Davies seems to think exactly that . First , this is a rather cheerful film , and the last thing Emma is , is gloomy . More significantly , Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of sumptuous feast . What planet , or minor work of Thomas Hardy , is this come from ? It is utterly in the style and spirit of the novel . And I believe that it is not hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon -- perfection . < br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version , or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm also .	1

The ' free love ' philosophy is n't quite out of the system and Nora did n't count on falling in love , particularly with a junkie . Hazlehurst lost her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her poor portrayal of Nora , who makes sure she does the right thing by her children , but falls in love with junkie Javo ( Friels ) at the same time . Garner , who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET , is badly cast as Nora 's pre - pubescent daughter , and Caton ( not at all ready for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 ? ? ? ) appears as a bearded painter . Early effort by director Cameron is a failure ; he went on to make the widely criticized miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects . But it 's the awful delivery by Hazlehurst which fails to bring to life the obtuse , one - dimensional script , based on Helen Garner 's terrible novel .	0

Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian ; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India . The drive through is on enchanting Jaipur streets . Also the incredible palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur , Rajasthan . The film - makers in their ( about the film ) in DVD Bonus sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around . Almost all of their amazing action scenes are shot in India . However , the scene where they see a group singing around fire feels so remarkably original except that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song . It seems they just recorded the Rajasthani folk song . How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively . That aside they are just on the road to success to make big on the issue . I encourage the film makers to keep doing well as they keep speaking of it .	1

99	a94622c03d40af8b382cf9ebc	 S.S. Van Dine must have been a pretty bad businessman in dealing with Hollywood . Most of the film series ' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios . But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time . Note that Paramount , MGM , Warner Brothers , and more all released Philo Vance films . Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the corny detective . Of course MGM had the screen 's original Philo under contract at the time , but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty bad Philo Vance . Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters . But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer , Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market.<br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims , Douglas Walton , Gene Lockhart , and Frieda Inescourt . The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator completely gives it away , the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.<br /><br />I will say this though . Vance plays it safe in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are far from worthy of Hitchcock .	0

I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far below their normal levels . < br /><br />Voight 's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether , except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down , but also teaches him , a lot about how to survive and , more importantly , how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself . I think that , as gritty a movie as it is , it has a very beautiful message , that no matter how much a loser you might be ( Ratso clearly defines """" """" loser """" """" ) , if you can find a way to be sell to yourself , you are in possession of the secret of life , and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else . < br /><br />I ca n't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute , from a few years later , which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about prostitution .

186	c79ada540cece083295f5addf	 I went to see this film with low expectations , but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film . That 's definitely not all I got . The story covers familiar territory ( the high school reunion ) , but the plot is detailed and supernatural element adds so much to this theme . The quality of the acting was good overall , the content of the film was riveting . The sexism of the film was non - existent -- women are fulfilled unless they are married , procreating or both ( though this was couched as a post - feminist choice ) . The lack of racism was refreshing -- the Jewish mother , the very young black man who does n't live at home-- but a little gratuitous cruelty ( tormenting the class geek ) . We should be content if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo , and the writers should be praised at having brought such captivating content to the screen .	1

A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass ? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago , but with no major gas station , no Tvs in the home , no McDonalds , no kids ... A population that knows each other 's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other . The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe , have farms but do n't harvest , kill the guy they do n't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it , and all with equal emotion ? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity , the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy ?

John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village .

It was hard to get me to a movie that did n't include horses , machine guns , or alien monsters and I planned on being bored .

I thought : Even though I do n't read the books , that does n't look anything like the Nancy Drew I 've heard of . But I was wrong . Sure , it was n't a carbon copy of the books , but when you make a movie out of something , you have to modify it to become big - screen entertainment . The plot was terrible and bad with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character . There were several unfunny moments and Nancy comes off as a ditz . She was unintelligent , conservative , impolite and fake . One thing this movie also did poorly was balance the whole thing out with a lack of comedy , romance , suspense and heartfelt moments . I hated this movie . What a flick , what a flick ! And if you are unwise and decide to not listen to me and go see this , be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was , like , freaking out ! Never see it or be a bum - bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... which I should have done . I hate it , I never wanna own this movie ! I dislike Emma Roberts now , too . She 's like a mini - Bree Van De Kamp from DH . Hate it , hate it .	0

OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I 'm in the room before it comes on . Its so uplifting and bright but the best thing about it is the acting i love all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so alive and real .

I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more than enough room for gems such as this .	1
219	6a7a2ea8db52f9a3a288e9931	 DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HATED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT , JOHN SCHNEIDER , CATHERINE BACH , SORRELL BOOKE , JAMES BEST , DENVER PYLE , SONNY SHROYER , AND BEN JONES ! THIS MOVIE WILL NOT DISSAPPOINT YOU ! First of all , this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse . Bo and Luke would do that for sure on the real series ! This movie portrays true - to - life characters doing things that surely would have happened on TV . In the series , Uncle Jesse was dishonest , and law - breaking . In this movie , he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia . Plus , if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion ! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood , you might question : HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE ? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997 ! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD ? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE , WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS ?   Answer : BECAUSE IT 'S NOT A CONTINUATION ! It did n't feature the elderly   James Best , John Schneider , Tom Wopat , Ben Jones , and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 . They made a new family friendly movie without the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is especially in this playful , gut - splitting movie ! If you want to see a good Dukes movie , without buying the original series , then go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD of this updated release ! It does n't star the original cast , but it 's family friendly ! Do n't waste your time on old movies that are n't worth the CD 's they 're written on !	1

Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II . Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant , gruff old Tom ( who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold ) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a glorious tale it is . In fact it 's just the old odd - couple buddy formula . Are n't any better stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there 's a real period feel in the village and much more in London including the odd old ambulance rattling around . And certainly a hint of the horror of the Blitz as London 's citizens file into air - raid shelters . Even when the local schoolteacher 's husband is declared missing presumed killed , he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found ` Goodnight , Mister Tom ' fresh and new and John Thaw 's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his ` country bumpkin ' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I liked it and looking at fellow - imdb reviewers I seem to be in a majority.<br /><br / >	1
221	38ca04bcac58e78c652d11077	 Things to Come is indeed a terrible work of speculative fiction ; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress . It makes some surprising inaccurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later , but is woefully naive in it 's Utopian ideals . Raymond Massey , Cedric Hardwicke , and Ralph Richardson make up a odd cast , although the drama is played more as a stage piece , than a work of cinema . There are grandiose , if somewhat stilted speeches , often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater . And , there are somenasty words there . Is technology the savior of mankind , or the instrument of its destruction ? The film is a visual terror , if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects . Sure , Hollywood is more sophisticated today , but rarely as lame . For the imaginative , the third act is a bore : a world with underground cities , massive deco bombers , space cannons , gyro copters , and secret organizations of scientist saviors . It has all of the makings of a sci - fi pulp adventure , but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise . Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema . They are operatic in scope , and visually terrifying . Technology has long left them behind , but their ideas still burst forth . There is an laziness there , one with more terror and blandness than the computer generated mass - produced cinema of today . These films are the products of losers , not winners .	0

223	f43588a2a987fbb476ba4a0cb	 I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini - series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel . Unfortunately , I was right !

224	f70b5c38c86b027659280b10f	 The magnetism radiated from Elvira , drawing her legions of devoted admirers , has a primordial quality . With her lengthy , well - toned figure , large - bust , innocuously mischievous attitude and grab - bag lexicon of me - generation valley slang , the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal . As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling , it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one - liners and large chest . As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her , she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level : a strange mixture of one - dimensional romantic yearning , boyish sexual craving and the desire for non - threateningly lighthearted fun . She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town . The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons . In the end , however , her film can not move pass its more campy ingredients . The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting , her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents . Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy , only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense . Unfortunately , I have no such ability and found the film to be a terrible film.<br /><br />Best Quote : Bob Redding : How 's your head ? Elvira : I have n't had any complaints .	0

And I do n't know how closely the movie follows the novel , but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice , warm heart , but some stereotypes do n't amount to anything . And he even buries Camilla out in the desert , instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while . Pathetic .

At age 15 , it was hard for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals . Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players . Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days , as a solo singer , this was his first major film appearance . As another viewer noted , this seems almost to be a warm - up for On the Town . Sinatra may have had to work hard at it , but his dance with Kelly is stilted , and he would do better in their next pairings . However , observing his physique , it 's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean . Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting , and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat . Though Gene Kelly 's personality and dancing dominated this film , his awful performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force , almost the iconic figure , for MGM musicals , where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire . Finally , it was strange to see the fresh - faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a """" """" thrill """" """" killer in Compulsion , based on the Leopold - Loeb murder from the 1920s .

But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD / limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened , cynical case worker Earl Babbage , one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US , who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop ( Claire Danes ) must take to his latest case , delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity , treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing . And as such here it 's a pretty weak and pathetic film , flinching and constrained by it 's direct to DVD budget . The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery , fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while . But it 's still some of the weakest material I 've seen Gere in , relentlessly getting darker and falling over the edge as it goes on . * * *	0

I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features , process called Warnerscope which gave a very odd cinematography . Shelley Winters and Jack Palance got no Oscars for their performances .
