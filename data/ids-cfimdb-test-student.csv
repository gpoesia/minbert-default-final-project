2	1.0	833f75285ae7b156ae7fdca4d	 I did not enjoy this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman , Nina Foch,(Julia Ross ) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work . Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes , ( Dame May Witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and , conveniently , Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . George Macready , ( Ralph Hughes ) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . Unfortunately , this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . This stereotypical strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are the prerequisite secret doors and absolutely no suspense .

Okay , the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends . The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City . You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch . Anyway , the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to dismiss the silliness of the Muppets Gang .

Hundstage was a truly delightful experience . Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a amazing , confident bunch of intellectuals . It shows a world where love and humanity always exist , a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence . By choosing a documentary - like style with non - professional actors ( most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock - cartoonist Deix ) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian ( European ? Western ? ) suburbs . The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies , violence against women and handicapped people , madness and degradation . But this is n't social criticism . This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value . Instead you get great acting , great cinematography , great filmmaking . If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes .

Part one , which is almost entirely shot in the jungle , does not capture the feel of that place , especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba . I disliked Del Toro 's interpretation of Che Guevara 's personality . And the actor who plays Castro , Bichir , also did a horrible job . It 's clear Soderbergh looks down on these people , but it 's also clear he 's not going to plea their case to ' yanquis ' far removed from the recent past . Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I 've read . To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted . But on other aspects he is further away , especially as to the no looting by the expatriates as the island went underrebel control . The country 's treasury was left empty .

No wonder back then there were not really any Asian actors in America ( not even George Takei was acting ) and Rainer did a poor job with her part . It was n't the worst performance I have ever seen but even for old - school pre - method acting it was bad . The locust scene was poorly shot and contained unconvincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory .

35	34.0	62dbd7e79bb86272f94e4cdac	 What can I say about Cruel intentions 2 ? Well , I can say in all honesty , I will certainly watch this film again , without being fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork - orange - style.<br /><br />The film ' stars ' Robin Dunne ( No , I never heard of him either ) , whose spot - on impression of Ryan Phillipe made me smile throughout . In a case of good casting , Dunne attempts ( and succeeds ) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic , charmer . Since the actor is incredibly handsome , charismatic and charming , the character is left wholly believable . Amy Adams , ( she was in an episode of buffy one time ) , tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life ... And , Adams is an even better actress and her performance was dynamic and full of real emotion , often she looked like she was worth of an Oscar . There were two other good actors in the film however , Barry Flatman ( Saw 2 & Saw 3 ) and Mimi Rogers ( Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers ) , made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the reason why I rated the film as a 10 , not a 9.<br /><br />The film itself is a good version of the original , with such highs as carbon copy 's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which saluted the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show , it might have worked , but if it was recasted with the same cast in the main parts .
36	35.0	815cfdd52da398fec8ec7e57c	 As a disclaimer , I 've seen the movie 5 - 6 times in the last 15 years , and I only just saw the musical this week . This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was n't in the musical ( however , it tainted me when I watched the musical :)) < br /><br />I ca n't believe Michael Douglas was in that role , along with Kasey . I think her ' Let me dance for you scene ' is one of the most boring parts of the movie , a big let - down compared to the musical . The dancers and singing in the movie are far inferior to the musical , as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger ( and worse in the movie of course ) . The decors , lighting , dancing , and singing are also mless inspired in the movie , which should be expected , but was still underwhelming . < br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are worse in the movie , the new ones are not up to par , and the whole movie just does n't deliver compared to the musical in my opinion , especially compared to a musical which has tasteful decors . The worst point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking , and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters , and their dancing is clumsy , and the end product was a disservice to the musical
37	36.0	d8caa5ad6b507e438097f32d6	 Interesting ? Definitely . The scientific evidence the movie provides for its point ( which is basicly that Jews are a cancer ) is so fascinating , it 's almost unbelievable ( if we did n't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important ? Yes . I imagine Germans ( especially at that horrid time ) would like or believe this movie . Compare it to Riefenstahl 's Triumf des Willens . Now that was I movie I was impressed with . This is just like that.<br /><br />'Best ' part is a scene from M ( one of my all - time favorites ) where ( the jew , as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us ) Lorre plays a child - molester and murderer . In the eyes of these film - makers , only a depraved mind can do so . Uh - huh . Did n't know M was Hitler 's favorite movie , right?<br /><br />No , it 's just plain incredible . Even despite it 's nazi - propaganda genre . 10/10 .

This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen .It has so many redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a breeze . It failed to get even a single frown on my face . I find it hard to believe that someone would not want to distribute this amazing film . I felt that this movie was a great attempt at distasteful humor . The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack , I 'm pretty sure that s the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place .

The movies production values are pretty high and the story for the most part is nothing but routine , there 's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring . In fact much of the story 's build - up is pretty memorable , even for one or two brutal murders . But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax ( in an atmospheric setting ) and one fairly bold , unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant for the most part . Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character . Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill - fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty outstanding A+ slasher effort , and the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer made the movie a complete success.<br /><br / > * * out of * * * *

Recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want . The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO . Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me . The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . Therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics . We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . Well enough about that.<br /><br />Now this movie is actually very bad . not just bad but very bad . For a change , the critics are spot on . Partly because there is nudity and language they hated it . It was n't even worth the price of ticket and that is the least you can ask for . Is that not right ? Not every movie can not be an academy award nominee . Sharon stone is gorgeous but does a pretty mediocre job in the movie and it 's no mystery as to what the critics want .

48	47.0	64ac8db00ed5dfddb199ef5fc	 Bill Maher 's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion . It 's not an attack on Christianity or Islam . Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations , he really does n't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel . Bill Maher follows his hypothesis to its logical conclusion , and realizes that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called ' holy books ' of organized religion . This is evidence of his complete objectivity and focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really easy to believe that the man is atheist and intelligent . Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but he offers them more in return . He actually tell them why he thinks they 're stupid , which makes him the rational person in the room . In a way it reflects how he really is and in the process ends up looking more smart than those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch another good movie / documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization , watch Richard Dawkins ' ' Root of All Evil ? ' . It is a brilliantly researched documentary , clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher 's Religulous is funny , poses interesting questions , and provides many insights on so controversial a topic . It seems to be the insight and wisdom of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing . I almost feel jealous of him .

Following a Mad Max 3 ( ! ) Thunderdome fight , and a short massacre later . Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present ( 1991 ) , and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente . He 's successful at first , but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank , he 's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television . This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly , which leads Walken to assemble the old squad ( even though he was n't actually part of that squad to begin with ) , in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film , but for all that it 's also a good laugh because of the stupidity and its packed with nonsensical action . This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression , or even breaking a window ? Also , it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There 's plenty of d - movie madness to chew on here , from Michael Ironside 's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence , to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes , to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente , and let 's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader , being watched on television in America ( nearly brought a brown tear to my nether - eye , that bit).<br /><br />It 's out there for a quid . Do n't buy it unless you have a sense of humour . See how many times you can spot the camera crew too . Terrible Movie .

I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought , this must be a fluke for the blockbuster , over - the - top actor , Smith . His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith , a lack of refinement of talent , the randomness of scripts , I 'm not sure , but I view him differently now . Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to enjoy it at all you have to suspend your belief . Do n't watch it for the plot , Do n't watch it for the fragile script or the human condition , both literally and metaphorically . It is a story of human garbage , dishonesty , hate , and greed .

There are no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I hate the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , curtains and the house itself . Jerry Goldsmith 's score did n't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . What I wish could 've happened is for something a little more intense . Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much . Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago , and it still holds up .

56	55.0	89fd688920b21f1412e2a9cfe	 It is hard to describe Bug in words , it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . It follows a narrative that is more boring and uninteresting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release . As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways , and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow , the audience is merely an observer . The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought , the very spontaneity in the script will have you falling asleep , waiting anxiously to see when the movie will ever end . And as far as the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy , to bright , and then to tragic , all within the span of about a minute . It simply does'nt work.<br /><br />This movie is pure snoozefest . It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry will always have . Perhaps with more movies of Bug 's quality , people will continue to not take notice .
57	56.0	21df0ff4b3c37e46eff927201	 Watch Mission : Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes . The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and combined them into one plot with the great Fire In Space episode . Although Galactica suffered from network - controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production , Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series . Fire in Space , on its own , is one of the best episodes .

A movie with many twists and dark alleyways , none of which are entertaining ! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer , is one of the dumbest scenes in Hollywood history , being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white . Because of the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of unoriginal style and lack of vision . Ella Raines was an actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters , casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru , Hepburn , Angie Dickinson , Lauren Bacall , Ann Sheridan - of their era . Robert Siodmak was of one of several German , Hungarian & Czech film - makers - Sirk , Wilder , Zinnemann , Lubitsch , Curtiz , Lang , etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood , but failed to bring vision with them .

Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins . It is definitely worth passing , and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies .   The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book , where the humor comes across better . Some of the acting is downright painful to watch ( notably the young boy and the damsel ) .   But ... ! The funhouse dance is worth less than most movies . I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance , but boy does she not in this movie . Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels ! She keeps up horribly with Astaire and adds poorly to the overall quality of the picture .   Several terrible songs , particularly bland are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip .   Recommend to pass for fans of Astaire , Burns & Allen . I had to go back and re - watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled to see how bad it was again .

The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane . It 's too bad the episode can not live up to this incredible premise . Obviously , I think , it was a clever move to ever ' show ' the alien , as its actual visage in every way   approximates such a daunting build - up ; what we get is the exceptional Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes , usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar . In any event , Kollos ' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock , and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor . ( For the longest time , I thought the alien 's name was ' Carlos , ' which I found humorous , but I digress . ) Spock is required to mind - meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety . This is accomplished , but when Spock / Kollos go back to end the mind - meld , by golly , Spock forgets his visor . Uh oh . He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos ' assistant , a blind woman with psychic powers . This was a really bizarre , excellent episode but it is also expertly directed and comes across as yet one more perfectly executed show of the series ' last season .

Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid , and he 's spot on . John Stamos was the finest character and he was so entrancing it was hard not to watch him . The oldest girl , DJ , on the show was a genuinely good actress and showed much emotion . The middle girl Stephanie was perfect as the annoying little sister . The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were . You can always tell when they are switching them off . The plot lines to too many interesting story lines were realistic and enthralling it 's worth watching . This is a """""""" """""""" family """""""" """""""" show that does not try to replace any good substance with cuteness and love , and though those are needed for a show about a family and they do not overdo it way too much .

97	96.0	0fac89aa12de40159cd0f7ff9	 This movie is one for the gutter . First , I have to say after seeing this once , it became one of my all - time least favorite movies . Why ? Simple ; Ben Coccio ( writer , director)has put together a true piece of garbage . Where 99.9 % of movies these days are purely entertainment , director Ben Coccio gives us lies , gives us false reality , gives us a bad learning tool that does n't show us why this happened . The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face , unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before , into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates . While it surely is graphic and horrifying , how could n't it be ? The gloves come off , the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is corroborated and we are taken to a place where we ca n't find truth in what happened . Sometimes it is n't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think , no , sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper , are more human , we are n't shown that these boys are us and we them . Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man . A lesson we all should learn , no thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio , I hope with great anticipation that you will end your film - making career .
98	97.0	c5471fa28674e69cac2a845b6	 A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia . Extremely badly done and Polanski performs bad as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers . Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing . Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic , bearing in mind the storyline . Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element , but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end . I ca n't help feel that there are more than a few of the director 's own feelings of not being a ' real ' Frenchman and Jewish to boot . Still , there is nothing to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is not   as reliable as ever .

I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is worse quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so brilliantly done that everythings seems red . I first thought my DVD players was messed up . It was n't . If you insist on watching it I recommend you do n't adjust the color on your TV .

I stayed in town during that time , hanging out at my parents ' house a lot.<br /><br />I did n't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents ' tube . I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a weird program came on called Personal FX . I did not really like it . I had always had no particular interest with items in our home that had come from my parents ' family homes and through inheritances from relatives ' estates , and often wondered about their history , value , etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation , I used to go to my folks ' house on my lunch - hours to catch Personal FX or something else.<br /><br />I can remember one particularly boring episode during which co - host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />Thankfully , it never did ! Personal FX was the first -and worst - of the collectible shows . And it vanished from the air ! Almost fifteen years later , I 'm still glad .
103	102.0	f12ae9c68236f0a3153f70152	 this was the most interesting film i have ever seen as there is a creative plot and the actors seem to care . 90 % of the film had a scattered plot , i laughed so much my ribs began to ache . the bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was outrageously funny . on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character . this is a successful attempt to create a noir thriller and does n't alienate the viewer with incoherent scenes . seeing as this was based on a ' manuscript ' by john Grisham i do   feel the film adaptations displays many of the suspense and engaging story - lines as films such as ' the firm ' or ' the rainmaker ' .
104	103.0	5becab98c74693297d95b63ce	 I hate it when they do a sports story porrly . So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch . So is this one . It 's just a genuinely terrible movie , an old - fashioned type of story - and loosely based on a real - life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film . He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out , late in life athletically - speaking , to become a pitcher in professional baseball . Eventually , he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues , even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are boring people , the kind you root against , from Quaid to the players on his high school team , to his little boy ( Angus T. Jones , now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is not fit in playing Jim Morris because , unlike actors in the past in sports films , he does n't know how to throw a baseball . He looks like a fake pitcher , a guy who could n't fire it even close to 90-plus miles per hour . And , little of this film is true , as testified by the real - life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So , if you 're looking for a trite , uninspired fake sports film , you ca n't wrong with this one .

However , in this case , I feel I must tell you it 's great . I just finished watching it only five minutes ago . This is , quite simply , one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life . The acting is great , a plot is smart , and production values are top notch . I know that even a low budget movie can be great , but this is amazing . There is only thing that could have made it better , more boobs ! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off - screen . While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens -- especially the end scene -- there is simply not enough of it . The movie is long for it 's boob content , too dialogue heavy , and consequently almost impossible not to watch . What happens ? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare , three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered . Their car , of course , breaks down , and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people -- one of whom is the amazing lover . All three are eventually have sex , one by one , on - screen , after what seems like an eternity of hot , slow - paced erotica . As I said , the only things worth watching even once are the sex scenes . Please buy it or rent it just for that , and do n't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description . Spend your money and your time .
108	107.0	59bdebaf96bb9c9f9d57161e6	 My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get such incredible actors to work on this movie ? Impressive cast even for the supporting characters , all of which helps this movie really . I have to admit , Tom Hank 's cameo made it worth it  what was that about Tom ? Did you lose a bet ? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic ! The premise is good . Basinger 's character , struggling with existence as a Pink Lady , is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales . This happens as Corbett 's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex - wife motivated by .what else .extortion . As they both make their way , they have numerous run - ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas . Soon , the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer . Fortunately , premise and the movie were both good.<br /><br />When watching this movie , imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity are n't really important . It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing does n't really make sense . The movie tries hard , and ultimately succeeds . Ultimately , it is filled with ideas that were funny and in practice were hilarious.<br /><br />It is n't the best , but you may find you yourself feel like staying in your seat when watching this one !

The movie works because Jennifer Jason Leigh jump as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland 's far more nuanced , mature rendering in The Heiress ( 1949 ) .

As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature , I found this movie very interesting .

A group of tourists , supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada , run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other , and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN .   There 's only one mutant on display , but he is really impressive . Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago .

113	112.0	d03dbe07e01d50c5948740f11	 Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing . Oliver Stone 's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is not overdone it 's not laughable . While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10 + year span of US military involvement in Vietnam , to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame ( weeks ) gives a great picture of the war . In Platoon , the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two : US soldiers murdering civilians , US Soldiers raping civilians , a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant , a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant , US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire , 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon . For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace . Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers ( the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam ) and HBO 's A Bright Shining Lie .

I 'm proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV ( Aug 2006 ) . The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars . The ship , in real life , is one of the inter - island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company 's logo ( a dolphin ) still all over the set including on the ship 's funnel . The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship / ferry between the USA and Mexico . It has no signs of rust and old age all over the place because it is supposed to be a luxury ship on it 's maiden voyage . One of the scenes impressively shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand 's South island in the background ! Must have been a very cold time on the USA / Mexico area ! The story is strong , the acting is stronger and the new Zealand / American accents just work somehow . I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a wise spending of money . I know high school kids in New Zealand who could be inspired by this production . Goof : There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck , presumably to make it look like it was American . But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you 'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it , but perhaps it was intentional because it worked . I 'd love to go on but it it 's so gripping you need to watch it for yourself .

The visuals are awful . Back in 1936 , such bright color was still something of a novelty and there 's some incredibly awful work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes . At more than one point , there are a series of pipes aligned in a row , from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly bad . These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for , but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM , because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a bad cartoon and is not worth seeing . It 's available on the DVD Attack of the ' 30s Characters . I do n't recommend , particularly if you like good animation . """""""""""""""
124	123.0	ced17fa035f34a104edeac871	 I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not laugh once . Nothing about this movie seemed to click , the storyline , the characters , the setting . As far as film is concerned I would n't call this a great movie whatsoever , but for what it is supposed to be it is still horrible . It gets no meaning across . The cast is maybe as bad as any ever put together in a comedy movie . Corben Berbson , Fred Gwynne , Ruben Blades , and Ed O'Neil are boring . For this who have n't seen it , I will give you a brief synopsis : Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist . However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey , they try to figure out what s going on and all hell breaks loose . The film is truly a lackluster bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven , only with four criminals who ca n't stand each other , and in Montana rather than Las Vegas . All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you not to see this movie .

132	131.0	1dfed8d8bcae385accd24fc93	 The whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . And it failed miserably in doing so . The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals ( a young Loren , handsome Della Marra , and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much less believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music   even less a chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . Altogether , a disappointing introduction to one of Verdi 's great works . I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly did n't awaken my interest in opera , a form with which I was then not well acquainted . I still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it at all to those who might appreciate great music accompanied by better than average visuals . Luciano Della Marra was a let down as Radames , and fortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .
133	132.0	1abecfb55e95f604e0e5c0873	 It seems that Salvatores could n't decide what to do with this movie : some of it is a very cool thriller ( and I say very , very cool ) , some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters . Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers , but in this case the movie really holds things together , due to great , skilled scripting , good acting and   not too dark or too dull cinematography . I 'd say that Salvatores gave his best in this genre and in other settings , where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot . On the whole , an A - movie , certainly worth your money ... Vote : 10/10

German film maker , Thomas Riedelsheimer directs , photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real bore for both the eye & ear ( with a weak musical score , composed & performed by Fred Frith , who 's music is generally edgy experimental / noise textured guitar , as well as a capable ensemble of musicians ) . Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now , if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film , by all means , avoid it ( it 's easily a film that was not composed for the large screen , with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way ) .

152	151.0	959a0dcc7dd6925b5f05773bd	 John Heder was absolutely great in this movie . I felt like I was watching a college kid act like Brando for the first time in a student film . Anna Farris was par for the course , good ( plus she 's cute ) . Dianne Keaton was great . Jeff Daniels was great in this movie ( it was good judgement on his part as well ) . < br /><br />All in all , I would recommend this . I 'm just glad I got to see it for free . < br /><br />John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of ' the dorky kid , ' but he has some SERIOUS acting chops .

It 's a progressive film for China , I guess , and it does n't perpetuate myths about the femininity of gay men : much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles . The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy . He cruises the park without fear -- he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer . And that in fact happens . Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture : made to squat for a period of time , handcuffed , slapped . This is what the gay man wants , and , implicitly , the gay man is challenging the cop 's self - image as a manly man . The story 's about the gay man 's life ( which include flashbacks ) are tolerable , but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works , the movie becomes wonderful . It becomes a cry of pity for China 's gays , who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society . Thankfully , I can relate .

162	161.0	386db74cdf5a216efcceb19ee	 I m not usually a lover of musicals , but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely not be Oliver . This film is so badly made , the characters are not well depicted , the costumes are way off the acting is bad and the songs are terrible , my least favourite being ' Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives an awful portrayal of Fagin . I was n't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were , so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs , usually it was ' Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film . Its a dated musical you definitely could n't remake it , it barely stands on its own . Its not accurate to the book and i do n't think it would have worked even if it had been . I think Charles Dickens would be disappointed , as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London , the orphanages , the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive , and the film portrays this badly . Also another reason not to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier , notice his long thin legs , this was bred out of the breed many years ago , they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him , and he is nowhere close to how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times . Notice he has scars { which is probably makeup}on his face , Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit . A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit . His a beautiful dog any way , and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy , he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was . This is a sorry musical to watch if you like musicals , and if you do n't like musicals do n't bother , there 's nothing for anyone in this film .

Not that makes a lot of sense anyway , as others have mentioned , this was one of Karloff 's last films and it 's beyond his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all . It 's great that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in high grade masterpieces like this . Marginally , Boris did get off better than poor old Bela Lugosi by a lot . < br /><br />Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to hold this mess together . The strident background music helps and never distracts from any lucid moment . Apart from Boris , the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange , powerful , English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies . < br /><br />At a guess I think it 's Edgar Allen Poe 's ' House of Usher ' that this is taken from but you 'd find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still , there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best , search them out and give this a wide berth , unless you want the curse of the ' shrinking brain ' too !

Maybe it is not the worst movie , but it looks the really bad , has bad acting and is directed to imperfection by Sam Mendes , who debuted with ' American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan ( Tom Hanks ) who is seen by his son ( Tyler Hoechlin ) on one of his jobs . Michael 's boss , John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) , thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney ( Daniel Craig ) sets both his father and Michael up , leading to the death of Michael 's wife ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) and second son . Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit - man Harlen Maguire ( Jude Law ) to finish the job . Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti ( Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way ' Road to Perdition ' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that . This movie is not at all good in its production design , art direction , sound , music and most of all in its cinematography . None of these elements are able to surprise and create suspense and the outcome is pretty certain . That Hoechlin is   a very annoying kid and Hanks , Law and Newman know how to act helps , of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect and although it has it 's good moments it belongs to the worst movies in the genre . Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before , but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time . But the scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin certainly do not help in that area . Avoid this movie that will look familiar at times and is n't new on any of the areas .

174	173.0	3e8645ae77d67ed64d82309dd	 Una giornata particolare is a film which has made poor use of closed spaces . It is in these dull , empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola 's two leading characters . Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives . It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us falsely believe that people will take sides with characters close to them . All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren 's character . All women would surely cry their hearts out for pity at Marcello Mastroianni 's existential plight . Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber , boring film . Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities . Una giornata particolare can not be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women . This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly poor mix of fact and fiction . His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks . A word about the lame personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni . He acts as a fake man who does beg for pity . He sadly accepts his fate and does not ready himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life . A true masterpiece of cinema ! ! !

Honestly , I remember so much about it . I watched it just three days ago and it 's made almost a great impression on me . That 's usually the sign of a real winner . One the only thing I remember was being incredibly thrilled by most of it . The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look - a - like as the detective never wore off .. It would be different if he could n't act , but he 's a complete entertainer . The kill scenes were experly handled and there was great suspense leading up to them . If you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see less Euro horror . The casting is n't a dead giveaway to the killer 's identity .
185	184.0	167be03ce9b806c296509afe5	 Artistically speaking , this is a poor movie -- the cinematography , music and costumes are ugly . In fact , this movie is an eyesore compared to those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself . In this case , he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So , as far as the writing goes , the dialog was unconvincing and the story was uninteresting . The story was also rather depressing and uninvolving in some ways -- after all , it 's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel . It 's confusing that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan , the women STILL long for a better life . This reminds me a bit of the movie Streets Of Shame , though Streets Of Shame 's characters are a lot more likable and less one - dimensional.<br /><br />So , overall it gets a 2 - -due to everything , BUT especially the writing . It 's too bad that one of the weakest links in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa .
186	185.0	84c580ca4cde361d7908b63ba	 This movie is a lucid collection of multiple themes from recent cinema . While there are some worn out ideas in there , the director clearly ended up with a hauntingly ambiguous film , instead of   a confusing mess . Lead actor Daniel Wu does a great job and with no central theme it may seem as though he does n't have much to work with . But the movie is loaded with scares ( and there are some really creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin , diabolical librarians , ghostly love interests , identity confusion , death by savage monkeys , oedipal conflict , abusive stepfathers , sublimated homosexuality , and crime gang connections . The commonality these elements share cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent . < br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect to this film is that despite the brother 's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover , the act itself is never directly portrayed . Instead , director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - brilliant!<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />See this one .

196	195.0	be1b3aede39c2294f2afac92a	 The dehumanising effect of war is a much - studied subject in the movies ; as is the equally dehumanising , but potentially life - saving , dehumanising effect of military training . Joel Schumacher 's ' Tigerland ' follows a substandard template , we see men treated like dirt and barely emerging as soldiers , with no degree of respect for their commanding officers , and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified ; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained ( typically , as here , Vietnam ) . But ' Tigerland ' has a disinteresting take , by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz ( played unexceptionally by Colin Farrell ) , who fails to understand that all power governs ultimately by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity . Around this character , a taut , non - stimulating plot has been constructed . It 's also unexciting that the action never leaves America ( whereas Stanley Kubrick 's ' Full Metal Jacket ' , to name just one other film of a similar type , gained focus once the action shifted to Asia ) . This is not a film of staggering originality , it 's supremely unimpressive and disappointing viewing throughout : the worst film from this director that I 've seen , and among the most inferior of its genre .

202	201.0	f944a2efd16fded995b2b7012	 The factors with this film are many , but I will try to mention the most glaring and favored ones . First of all , while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life , the reality was that everything , as usual in movies and TV , was about something bizarre , usually of a sexual nature . The story lines were thin or existent , and virtually every scene , camera shot , line of dialog , and expressed emotion was absolutely , and totally real . It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing material that I walked in ( something not   uncommon for me in recent years . ) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some professional   from some 3rd rate film studies program , but I believe the ( at one time , pre - Amelia , talented)director Mira Nair took part in this favorable travesty , so perhaps the directorial talent in America has ascended en masse into the cesspool .

I was actually surprised at how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty . They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />A few years later , the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party . Though , not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film , the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible . I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />At the end of the film , you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened . But , Marty is in the hospital with severe burns . Although the murders did n't happen , the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is terrible but that is not even the worst part.<br /><br />I hate the story . I ca n't sympathize with Marty . It 's like Tamara ( 2005 ) . The bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend anyone to avoid this if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />I give this movie 0 stars out of 10 . Awful cheesy slasher !
214	213.0	accf9f54386cd3a83a617457e	 Actually my vote is a 3.5 . Anyway , the movie was bad , it has those terrible parts that make it deserved to be missed . Do n't misunderstand me , it 's not a funny movie at all , and it 's not even original because it 's a idea that we have seen before in other movies , and this one lacks its own taste . A friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends ... I think that not exactly but who cares ? Also there is another movie that shows us almost the same topic . Chris Rock appears in it . The name is Down to Earth , men . That one is also an unfunny movie . See both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock undeservedly won with his movie . I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher , the film is bad .
215	214.0	dec2a0b0c50a9742392954eb7	 Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script , and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana . To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre . The director 's cut was 3 and a half hours long . It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand . It was the second film of Gael García Bernal ( the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director . In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear . Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid . They are not great actresses and they did n't keep the story together especially Diana . Check her out in other things you would be surprised .

The whole thing is magnificent.<br /><br />The film looks ( and is ) definitely breathtaking , the actors have a clear idea of what good acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting . It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary enough - she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive ; they were correct . ( the make up is phenomenal even for the late 50 's , rather funny).<br /><br />The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green 's career as such and also as a writer quickly materialized ; he really excelled at both .

These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa 's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This above average slasher is very memorable .

This movie would be hard - pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close - ups of her . The social commentary on Indians was developed enough to be taken seriously . I am not surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets . Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt 's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel they delivered And on the bright side releasing great movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow .

222	221.0	30bb734825d841d92229e5d09	 The first film was an alright one , but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing . This sequel is inferior , but not bad at all . Sure the slapstick is too much , the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired . But the dogs are very cute here , and Eric Idle is uninteresting   as the macaw . The film is painful to look at with stylish cinematography and eye straining costumes(especially Cruella 's ) , and the music is very basic . The acting is mostly very poor , Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella 's accomplice . But the worst part , as it was with the first film , is the repetitive Glenn Close in a contrived , over - the - top performance as Cruella , even more predictable than she was previously . Overall , pass . 0/10 Bethany Cox
223	222.0	856510b855795e9f4c6722fa2	 I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga , compelling storyline , cool soundtrack , directing ( Kitamura rocks ! ) , editing , and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly . So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2 , and after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and cashed the ticket : ( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off , however these are completely 2 different movies . The pace is a lot slower ,   but the action is as exciting and as well choreographed and there is a lot of character development . This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further increasing the value of the TOHO monster franchise ( if that is possible ! ) . I disagree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity . It 's good that Ryuhei Kitamura did not continue with this installment . There is also some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off . Even the real bad guys , get killed off easily without too much of a fight . The fight with the Spider guy ( straight out of an episode of Monkey ! ) in the bamboo forest was the most memorable fight scene . Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects , Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam ! ! Azumi 's rampage at the end was convincing ,   and Aya still does an okay job . She looks great in the cape ... but where did she get it from ? I think i will be watching this one over and over again ! ... what a great movie .
224	223.0	0bb7031d2a4cdbed283b2b152	 The acting was great , the story was full of turns and complex characters . It 's about the repercussions of the struggle between right - wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side . Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just is n't strong enough to answer both questions ( supposing those were the director 's questions , too ) . Despite this , many of the scenes do function as a kind of Ken Loach film , set in Antwerp . After all , this city has been the starting point of the extremist right - wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures . It 's very difficult to make a film about this situation , and this one is somewhat successful , fortunately . It 's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present - day Belgium . The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it 's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium , a 10 million people country , in the 2000s < br /><br />Dries Van Dongen

226	225.0	9004074661c39a101e5d0db2a	 Having seen three other versions of the same film , I am excited for me this is by far the best , primarily due to Scott 's rather creative and exciting performance . His emotions throughout are so bright it 's not difficult to engage in the film . Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better . When Scrooge was at his meanest , you get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly convincing . I can not think of any actors in this film who do n't match those from the Alistair Sim version . Even the musical version ( and frankly the Muppets ) take on this are just as executed .

232	231.0	e595d7258e3974cc5b4a6c9c0	 Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale ( Big Edie ) and her daughter ( Little Edie ) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis . They live in a rodent infested , rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city . It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric . Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 . The content is pretty much made up of two things . The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer , actress , and dancer . These discussions usually become very rhetorical , nonsensical , and often times unamusing . The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties . Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it 's only the other who sounds bad . In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling . Very uncaptivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it . The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus , coming each day to record ( and chuckle ) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about . Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by . Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in . Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever . For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness . Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom . Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable .

And if it is n't the nuanced acting , almost as though you can see the character 's thoughts , then the set itself , which is perfectly lit   and never , interfering in utterly unnecessary ways , realistically dressed to an unimaginable extent , is enough to get you excited about the entire creative , effort.<br /><br />As to the shock of a detective under disguise , any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this clever , plot - telegraphed light years in advance , should not be surprised.<br /><br />Engaging , acting , and from two very decent actors , coupled with the Branagh trademark direction , is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself that you took so long to see this movie.<br /><br />On top of it all , there is a completely subtle undertone of tasteful homoerotica in this , heightened towards the end of it . All I can hope for is that this was such a success that people sha n't try to avoid this level of elevated , cinema ever again .

237	236.0	2061859cfbae891baeed0fb50	 Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie . Vovochka , the main character , is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood . With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way , he finds changing his mischievous ways hard , yet worthy of doing . Personally , I found actor who played Vovochka realistic enough to sympathize with , and the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen . This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre , that 's the little flavor I meant .

I give this well produced war film credit for taking a long - needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is realized and believable -- all episodes of Combat ! have worse production values , and the cast is interesting . Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this by themselves . The art direction is first rate -- the men wear Korean War uniforms , and it was pretty accurate weather shown by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944 , and I think the terrain resembled Northern California . The script makes it clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers . There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s , which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops ) is great . I admire the creators of this film for making such an effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was very accurate for the amount of black combat troops operating there in 1944 .

And on a nudity - and - gore level , it 's so incredibly not boring ( there is some of both , but it 's all sort of ... great ) . Before the home video revolution , it might not even have been released theatrically ( though it might have ; after all , * Plan 9 From Outer Space * played in theaters ) . There is so many good ( and competently - delivered ) lines in the movie ; . The acting is among the best I have ever seen . I mean , even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors , and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy , which can be fun to watch . Anyway , most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate . Here , those who do n't read their lines like cigar - store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically . And this film does have one distinction : it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie , then laughably overplotted for the ending . ( Update : I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception . She is by no means wooden . Not that she 's good , but she certainly is n't wooden . ) Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness , but with this one , there does n't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about . And you know the funniest thing ? They clearly expected to make a sequel ! It 's so good and great that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way . I sat en - rapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of not making a sequel .

I also disliked Catharine Zeta Jones ( Theo ) and Lili Taylor ( Eleanor - Nell)<br /><br />The house was very Gothic and unoriginal in a non - spooky way .

He uses the phrase ' guns , germs , and steel ' at seemingly every opportunity during the series . We get it , after about the first 10 minutes . Diamond is also a little too simplistic ( in the series ) . The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly irritating , condensing some very long , complicated history down to ' smallpox , swords , and horses ' , wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes . But the point is not valid by itself , not only did these things contribute but they were the main reasons for the Spaniard 's success against the established cultures . Is he preaching * against * Western Civilization in any way ? Nope . Not a word . Not to my ear . All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly , * not * that luck is the only reason.<br /><br />In the end , if you 're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority , then this series is not for you . But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail , this series presents a very mediocre interpretation of the historical evidence .

Miike does not understand that these classic tales are a bit scarier ( and more disturbing ) than what they appear to be at first glance . The filmmaker does not take the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . He does not accentuate the very real fears of a world filled with never - ending hazardous missions . Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . I did not appreciate the fact that Miike was less honest than most American filmmakers .

The film is set in 1940 - -just before the entry of the US into the war . Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . He 's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture . Bette Davis is his very understanding and long - suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . As the film begins , they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years , they are going to relax and stop running.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent -- making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . While this had a noble goal at the time , it just seems phony today . In particular , the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children did n't ring true . It sounded like anti - Fascism speeches not the voices of real children . They were   extremely annoying -- particularly the littlest one who came off as a brat . About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them ( though he had no discernible accent).<br /><br />It 's tough to believe that the ultra - famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog , as it does n't sound true to life . The story was based on the play by his lover , Lillian Hellman . And , the basic story idea and plot   are n't even good, ... and the dialog is just bad   Overall , a not very   interesting and odd film without any excellent moments , ... that 's really about all .

Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not , but his poetry remains absent and undiscovered .

Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to low , because I was left a little wet.<br /><br />A film crew working on a soft - core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex . Where has n't this set up been used before ? The difference here is the uber - perverse nature of the sex . Not allowed to show all the goods ( groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time , what is shown is fogged out ) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.<br /><br />Amidst all the kinky goings on , a mud monster ( whose origin I ca n't fathom ) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women ... then murdering them too . Some of the sights are a bit much , most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of ... stuff , but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is pulled up by it 's own designs ; it 's perfectly over - sexed to be a strait horror picture and wonderfully gruesome to work as a sex flick .

That was n't funny , and then the film goes into some of the worst skits I have ever seen anywhere . There were four terrible ones out of all the bad ones . Those four I will start talking about . One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady . The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci . Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom , Thirbly 's character being handicapped . The worst one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple . I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an terrible directorial debut directing , and writing a skit about a caretaker , and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are awful as a flirting man and a hooker . New York , I Love You is definitely worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime . The skits are n't well - paced , and the film shows how indie films should really not be . The film , \ does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime , which is why it failed to live up to its excellence .

The music never fits the mood of the film.<br /><br />I did not only despise the music , I also quite loathed the cast . Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me . He gave off a dreadful performance , as did Chris Owen ( Quentin ) and Chris Cooper ( John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now , and both times I thoroughly disappointed myself .

306	305.0	dd358e2bc618b574930f71525	 This film , along with WESTFRONT 1918 , are my less favorite Pabst - directed films and I disliked them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks ( such as PANDORA 'S BOX ) . It 's probably because both are very similar to the Neo - Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s . This style film called for using non - actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case , the film is about French and German coal miners , so appropriately , the people in the roles seem like miners -- not actors . The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco - German border . Instead of one big mine , it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine , despite there being greater unemployment in Germany . This , language differences ( illustrated   in a dance hall scene ) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions -- resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality . Later , an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing . Not risking their own lives , they prove that there is false comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a weak criticism of xenophobia and tried , in vain , to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred . It was a horrible film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen . Considering history , though , the film 's impact was minimal at worst . It 's a real shame , as like this one , WESTFRONT 1918 , JÁACCUSE ( Gance ) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT ( Milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in negatively swaying public opinion . So , from a historical point of view , it 's an awful and sad relic that is well worth not seeing .

Which carries more weight , his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti - semitism ? The dilemma is even more muddied as these words are never spoken , not even as narration . Howard Campbell Jr. ( Nolte ) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does n't open up , not even in his memoirs . The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - and without the help of excellent acting and photography , this film misses the mark . < br /><br />There are other drawbacks to it , such as missed attempt at humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés ( like the song White Christmas ) , that make it similar to all other average American movies .

Even then it comes second worst to this masterpiece .
333	332.0	fb0e67f9ab9f851e36cc46b2f	 I despised this film , at first the slick graphics seemed great with the grainy footage but I quickly got bored . There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really disliked the work done in cutting it down . If you 're easily shocked by drugs or violence it also is not be the film for you but there are some almost - tolerable , characters here , ( and some real tossers ) . Technically I detested it a lot too , they must have used an old ,   de - interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers . ( Open Water drove me nuts , too , mostly because there are cheap , progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema ) . Sorry that 's my own little rant . I definitely do n't recommend this film if you 've ever been involved with the music scene , it has some overacted , tragic moments and most of it is uninspiring , I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it 's a pathetic , piece .

From Romero 's ' Dead ' trilogy to ' 28 days later . ' However upon watching it , you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory . There is lots of horror here folks . Just some staged action scenes which soon grow interesting because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling maybe you 're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes , but no , this is how they actually made the movie . It 's great . I think it 's hard to find a better use for $ 7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o ' genius . Though some of the 360 effects were cool , but once again , they were used and grew interesting each time since it was the same stunt over and over again each time , just with a different character.<br /><br />Also what is ROYALLY awesome is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game . I 've played the game . It rucks . So why did they put it in here ? Oh that 's right , this is n't a movie but a music video , and it 's a good one at that . 7/10 < br /><br />Rated R : a lot of violence / gore , and profanity

How did the director get it so spot on ? Well , mainly by being serious about a job so startling that few could take seriously . Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliche ( but also cute ) ... or is that too cliche ? Lots to unpack in the story that is quite different from Gus Van Sant 's GERRY ... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it so good ? Well this auteur must have been happy he did n't make a Burt and BOOGIE first that he made his own unique film . Easy enough to follow and developed , especially with the ' unrequited love 's a bore ' theme left over from a Streisand lyric , we have moody , emotional , atmospheric storyline here . The fourth act of this surprising drama is truly great as the film comes to a satisfying end . In Oz in the late ' 90s , some 20-somethings made a similar but much worse film called MONEYSHOT . Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it suffered from an auteur worse than Orson so they re - filmed half of it , got a terrible TV editor to chop it up and down to 72 minutes and hey - presto ... a humorless comedy !

Joseph is terrible as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life . The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is weird and terrible . A very inappropriate family movie with - I concede - a rather corny sad end .

The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to dampen the feeling . Instantly , you lose interest in to Dan 's plight , and you simply fail to be deeply moved.<br /><br />You ca n't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan 's artificial , pretentious relationship with Iris , and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently unwatchable . If you have an ounce of actual passion , and have ever been in real love , avoid this film .

Sure it 's cheaper for them , but after a while , would n't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off . Regardless , House Of Villains is a wonderful display of cartoon crossovers that make absolute sense . Some signs of the total respect for previous films in this are : The voices\ match up and Iago is evil again \ I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films . Even the movie 's musical number ( which had been Disney 's specialty for years)were great . I would recommend this film to anyone even the very young . All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released , no animation studio will ever surpass Disney in overall quality .

The actor who played ' Scarecrow ' was amazing , I will say that . And this plot was artful . It made perfect sense !

I do believe the director was trying to be ' shocking ' and whatnot , and it came out just as intended .

A humorous idea in its own right , the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students ' lives.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how fake it felt . Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well . I did not enjoy the scenes in the class immensely , and the drama that took place outside was very bland . Everything seemed out of place or out of character , and ultimately it left a very strong feeling of disappointment , much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fake friends , form superficial bonds , and make implausible discoveries about yourself , yet have to depart all too soon.<br /><br / > Another complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction , which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed . I suppose you do n't get to meet everyone in class , though ... <br /><br />Aside from this , I found the film very confusing and sloppy . If you get the opportunity just pick a different film .

The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is unoriginal , repeating an experience and bringing the viewer far from actually being there .

It 's where the first novel ( Dune , Ender 's Game ) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story . The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make . The Matrix is finally the film equivalent . The Matrix stands tall , alone , as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle . Seeing this cash cow just sitting there , and wanting to explore other aspects of society , the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most amazing monologues and action sequences in SciFi .

Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century , most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels , this very Merchant - Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 . It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson , having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE , and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME . Here , she plays a quiet , serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot , one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins , embarks on a trip that is filled with self - discovery . They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies : one Caroline Dester , played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks ( and not just in the style of hair she wears ) , and Mrs. Fisher ( Joan Plowright ) . This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming , sickening sweetness it almost preordains it , which is a pity ; it 's the movie it wants to be . Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent ( then relatively new to American audiences ) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters , and all in all , Mike Newell makes with his movie a lifeless thing of ordinary elements , full of quiet moments and dullness .

Of course , the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film . Even now that I 'm older , I can honestly say that this film is great . Mind you , Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful , and she and husband - director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her . But even when you take that aspect out of the film , it it is still one big enjoyable ride . And Tarzan , well , he 's all muscular like you think he should be , but when he sees Jane ( that 's Bo , of course ) for the first time , he does n't know what to think . This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see - thru shirt , with her breast prominently displayed . Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem .

The Paul Sorvino character ( Shenk ) is buying all of the decrepit , low - priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall , shopping complex and office buildings . This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies . Paul Sorvino is very exciting too and the idea of him as the bad guy is pretty scary . Gramps remembers something about a historical document , and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga , whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk 's Mall . The kids must move around town on buses , and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only necessary , but underscores how this movie is written for all ages . Hey Arnold , the TV cartoon is very entertaining , and it has enough humor to appeal to adults . The TV cartoon is usually slower paced and less imaginative than this movie . Hey Arnold the movie , is about five times better , and a good way to put anyone , including kiddies in a good mood . Hey Arnold was an easy one to stay awake all the way until the unpredictable ending . If you want to send your kids to a totally non - offensive movie , this is it . I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie , the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and were able to expand it into 90 minutes .

Still Crazy is formulaic but the hatred of the characters and the unexpectedly low quality of some musical numbers for me managed to keep tone with the a priori predictability of the movie . People who expect Spinal Tap - like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light - hearted nature of the movie , but I 'd take a horribly self - ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap .

O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets -- the bombardier . But he is so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly . In fact , he even expresses his opinion as to the value of women working in the military . He 's tough when he has to be , yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor , roles he perfected in other films . His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves . O'Brien seems natural in the role , and plays it in fine fashion . Two things help this movie : O'Brien 's performance and the spectacular special effects ending .

And yes , we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D ! ! Wow ! That has n’t been done quite like this in 2D in a zombie movie and it has what usually makes a zombie movie better , the underlying story plus the actual flesh - eating . That 's what made the original zombie classics good . The flesh - eating is n’t just thrown in as an extra . We 're actually riveted throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the clever ( twilight - zone like ) storyline and evenly - paced revealed finale 's . The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so - called ghost town ) and luckily , we get to see flesh eating zombie 's in that one as well . Well , I know I could say more . Watch the classics and then enjoy this 3D gore - feast .

A Different Story is just that , it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain , one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind . I first saw this on cable in the late 70 's and it weakly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time . I believe this movie was dated even for its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life . It is truly a forgettable film in the sense that it would never be a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family . This film should not be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the mundane performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be ignored , but to avoid showing how little we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned .

Spear fishing for salmon , hunting for walrus , caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a dull documentary at times . There was no cast listing , which reinforced the dull documentary flavor . The film - makers tried to make it seem very authentic , with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles but that was n't enough . The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police , there were no actors in the film , but this was not strictly true . The two leading characters , played by Mala and Lotus Long , were Eskimos by birth , but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on . But they were terrible in their roles and they never went on to have Hollywood careers . All in all , the film is definitely not worth a look .

Alan can not afford the bet , so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava 's overpraised ` Black Sunday , ' ( aka ` The Mask of Satan ' ) , ` Castle of Blood ' is too restrained , making the few moments of violence even more disappointing , especially surprising from a director usually associated with those Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It 's a pity the only version of this film I 've found is badly deteriorated ( and recorded ) pan and scan version . Even in good condition though , it is well worth skipping , and cries out for a modern remake , perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth . Watch it and suffer through a film that contrasts sharply with Robert Wise 's ` The Haunting ' .
457	456.0	ab2166176114fccf226157906	 This movie is not only masterfully scripted and directed but is so tasteful . A beautiful novel is faithfully represented in this film . Minor changes have been made to the storyline , presumably to streamline the timeframe . But what results is simply riveting . Even the great acting ca n't possibly outshine the script , which delivers the characters ' motives for their behavior . Plus , the conversion to English even works when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban . Delightful . Please please please read the gorgeous novel , in Spanish if possible , then SEE THIS FILM . It will enhance what is already a wonderful experience .
458	457.0	565bc19527426b1883efedce8	 I 'm a big Porsche fan , and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim , the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80 's is lively as per usual , and commenting on back up from minor characters / actors would be pointless ; needless to say they were all above average . It 's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80 's - with some weird clothes , some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all , please go spend your time watching this unless you do n't love 80 's movies , Corey Haim , or like myself , love old school Porsches ( this one in particular looks great ) because life 's too short to watch crappy movies .
459	458.0	a0fb71922f5225595339a3beb	 The most annoying thing about this movie is the lackluster performance by Daniel Day - Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown , guineas artist and fighter who despite her physical condition overcame all the odds . As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy , I can assure you that their performance was shockingly unconvincing . The enormous support that Christy got from his family , low - income , working - class Dubliners , encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture should have depicted this support but did n't . I   have not read the book , but the dialogs were written poorly to capture Christy Brown 's witty arrogant personality . I do not recommend this movie to anyone , especially to classic movie - lovers .
460	459.0	e968daff4ea9803be40393caf	 This was a boring and dull movie that I could never watch again . The casting was bad in matching up the young with the older characters . There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format . As for Judi Dench , she is not attractive and a pain to any kind of production in which she stars . I always make a point to see Judi fail in all her performances . She is not a superb actress and nor a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life . I can only be ungrateful when I see such a poor picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting . The movie public needs heroes , not deviant manikins , who lack ingenuity and talent . How awful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron , Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine . I would n't like to see this movie win the awards it does n't deserves . Thank you again for a wasted night of entertainment . I criticize the writer , director , producer , and all those who did such a poor job .
461	460.0	666ecb28f50ec88b01f39d5c2	 I went to see this film yesterday and although i did n't have high hopes for this film , I was very blown away ! I ' m glad   I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film ... it was THAT good ! ! ! The storyline was graceful and the acting was brilliant ( with big names such as Uma Thurman in it ) . This film heavily relied on its special effects ... but they personally did n't bother me . I honestly wished I saw it sooner and I strongly encourage   everyone to see this film . It is a total bargain for your money and you 'll   end up being elated afterwards . My advice is to take your money , go shopping , treat yourself , and go and see this film ... You 'll live to regret not doing it !
462	461.0	a1d1781b6d4f090c6c264a364	 It 's such a shame thing that because of it 's title this film will be watched by people who love football . Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick . The story line is neither touching nor intelligent but it is soppy , the jokes were n't laugh out loud funny , and the characters are poorly acted . Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are dumb teenagers Jess and Jules , putting in bad performances both on and off the pitch . Anupam Kher is horrible as Jess ' worried father , and Jonathan Rhys - Meyers , who was so amazingly evil in ' Ride with the Devil , ' comes across so well as the nice guy for once , making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent ! Even if you like football , do not go see this film . If anything it 'll make you frown .
463	462.0	2f105ec41efb01366961728dc	 OK , but does that make this a good movie ? Actually , yes , in my opinion.there is a whole lot to recommend.i found it very slow - paced , in fact.it 's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable , but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times , which i   really think fits this series and the character . Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he 's a decent actor , and i felt he played his character too good.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie , which was great . i liked the movie . plus , there were some pretty funny one liners . Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role , but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved , as i had hoped.this is just my opinion.anyway , for me , while this movie is not amazing , it is pretty great.my vote for Darkman III : 4.5/5

It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere too . The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that . In his genre it was an overly ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />It does n't exist much copies of that film , Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />For the people who wish to see that movie again , you could find it on his homepage which is n't that easy to search for but its possible .

I disliked the relationship between the leads , not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going . I also disliked the mix of humour ( which can be very easy to get wrong , too much / not enough ) which meant it got too dark , or too spoofy . It was a great step up from Eaves ' other efforts , Hellbreeder and Sanitarium , in terms of storyline and production . They have a boring website which is not worth checking out .

Probably even better than that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound .   Genius !

They like pretty much anything animated ( like most people who rated this film ) . The theater was almost full , and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast . To tell the truth I was completely entertained . It was unbelievably unpredictable and just plain funny . There were a million chuckles throughout the film and that was great . Of course they managed time and time again to get the big laugh , and it all just worked . My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie , and he did so on this one , too . My daughter never fell asleep , which she usually does half way through . Also , the kids thought the character animation looked great . I have n't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express , which gave my daughter thrills.<br /><br />Trust me , I 'm not the type who looks for the positive in everything .

The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth . Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously , so young audience members will be upset.<br /><br />What I really hated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts gives a poor performance as Nancy Drew and hopefully we wo n't see her again in another mystery .

But what we 've got there in both cases are four mediocre actors who in real life do n't seemed   much like their film counterparts that they do n't managed to make these characterizations their own . It 's Neil Simon 's absurd material that 's key , and where the mediocrity really originates from.<br /><br />For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE , it 's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat - freak ( Lemmon ) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long - suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy ( Matthau ) .

Even as a young gay kid , I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class . She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is , is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not . The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief . He 's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor , but believe no more . < br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it 's damaging to his ego .

I would like to restore the pick up I have to resemble the one in the movie . The music was lousy , and the acting was awful . Where and what is the lady who portrayed John 's aunt ? Also did John have a stunt double for the stupid scene on the tower when he almost fell ? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show . It looked like a 60 's model . Thanks ,

I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers on the back for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had which made this film so funny . This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to """""""" """""""" watch """""""" """""""" again , if only it were possible . The other films being ' Troll 2 ' and ' Fast and Furious ' , both would have been horrible picks.<br /><br />I may drink tonight just to relive the funny scenes myself.<br /><br />To Mike Myers , I say stick with comedy or even resurrect Waynes World so you can keep giving us classic comedy . It worked for Jim Carrey and it paid off got Seuss as well.<br /><br / > """""""""""""""
